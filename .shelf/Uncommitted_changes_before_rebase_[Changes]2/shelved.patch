The database requirements are listed above. You can use CleanSpeak with either MySQL or PostgreSQL. Follow the instructions below to install a supported database.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nYou only need to install either MySQL or PostgreSQL to use CleanSpeak.\n====\n\n=== Install MySQL\n\nIf you want to use MySQL for your database, you will need to install version **5.5.3** or later. Depending on your operating system you can download and install MySQL or use the operating systems package management tools. Use the instructions below to install MySQL based on your operating system.\n\n==== Linux\n\nTo install MySQL on a Linux system, you can use the `apt` or `yum` tools depending on whether or not your Linux distribution is based on Red Hat or Debian. The package name may vary depending on your platform, for example: `mysql-server` or `mysql-server-5.5`. Here's the commands for each:\n\n[source,shell]\n.Red Hat\n----\n$ yum install mysql-server\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Debian\n----\n$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server\n----\n\n==== Windows or Mac OSX\n\nIf you are installing MySQL on a platform that does not supports RPM or DEB packages, you will need to download manually from the MySQL website here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\n\n==== MySQL and Unicode\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nTo properly store 4 byte unicode, the character set must be set to `utf8mb4`.\n\nBy default this configuration is enforced during startup. If CleanSpeak fails to startup due to this validation the log will contain detailed\nmessages about the MySQL configuration.\n\nIt is recommended to ensure you have properly configured MySQL to use `utf8mb4` before attempting to startup CleanSpeak. Please verify you have\nthe following configuration in your `my.cnf` file.

You will need to download one of the CleanSpeak WebService package that matches the operating system you will be installing CleanSpeak on.\n\n== Red Hat\n\nTo install on a Red Hat system (including Fedora and CentOS), use the RPM bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak WebService RPM (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ sudo rpm -i cleanspeak-webservice-<version>.rpm\n----\n\n== Debian\n\nTo install on a Debian system (including Ubuntu, Mint and Debian base), use the DEB bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak WebService DEB (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ sudo dpkg -i cleanspeak-webservice-<version>.deb\n----\n\n== Mac OS X\n\nTo install on Mac OS use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak WebService ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `/usr/local/inversoft`.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nYou can install CleanSpeak in any directory including your home directory. This is a good choice for development machines or when you don't have or want to use sudo to install CleanSpeak.\n====\n\nOnce the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n/usr/local/inversoft/config\n/usr/local/inversoft/config/keystore\n/usr/local/inversoft/config/cleanspeak.properties\n/usr/local/inversoft/cleanspeak-webservice\n----\n\n== Windows\n\nTo install on Windows 7 or higher use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak WebService ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `C:\\inversoft` on Windows.\n\nOnce the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\nC:\\inversoft\\config\nC:\\inversoft\\config\\keystore\nC:\\inversoft\\config\\cleanspeak.properties\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-webservice\\\n----\n\nNext, install the Windows service by changing to the directory you installed CleanSpeak (i.e. `C:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-webservice\\apache-tomcat\\bin`) and then running the install command. Here are those two steps:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\nC:\\>cd C:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-webservice\\apache-tomcat\\bin\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-webservice\\apache-tomcat\\bin>CleanSpeakWebService.exe /install\n----\n\n== Service Name\n\nAs long as your installation method installed CleanSpeak WebService as a service, the service name will be as follows:\n\n[cols=\"4h,6m\"]\n|===\n|Service Name\n|cleanspeak-webservice\n|===\n\nYou can use the operating system commands to start, stop and check the status of CleanSpeak using this service name.\n\n== Start CleanSpeak WebService\n\nNext, you need to start CleanSpeak WebService so that you can enter Maintenance Mode and allow CleanSpeak to create the database. Use the instructions below to start CleanSpeak based on the platform you installed it on. Also note that the `CLEANSPEAK_HOME` directory is the location you installed CleanSpeak WebService to.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nMaintenance Mode makes installation simple. However, sometimes it is not possible to use Maintenance Mode. For example, if you are doing an unattended install to a server. You can edit the CleanSpeak configuration files and install the database schema via the command-line using the <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> instructions below.\n\nIf you do not use Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak, do not start CleanSpeak at this point. Instead, skip the to <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> section and then return to this section after you have configured CleanSpeak and the database via the command-line.\n====\n\n\n[source,shell]\n.Linux (RPM or DEB package)\n----\n$ sudo service cleanspeak-webservice start\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Mac OS X (ZIP package)\n----\n$ <CLEANSPEAK_HOME>/cleanspeak-webservice/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Windows (ZIP package)\n----\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-webservice\\apache-tomcat\\bin>startup.bat\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Windows Service\n----\nC:\\> net start CleanSpeakWebService\n----\n\n== Maintenance Mode\n\nYou will access CleanSpeak WebService's Maintenance Mode setup via the browser. If you installed CleanSpeak WebService on your local machine, you'll access this interface by opening http://localhost:8011 in your browser. If CleanSpeak is running on a remote server, change the server name in the URL to match your server's name.\n\nThe first step of Maintenance Mode will prompt you to enter your license Id. You can retrieve your license Id from the CleanSpeak website by logging into your account here: https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/\n\nYou should see a screen that looks like this:\n\nimage::maintenance-mode-license.png[Maintenance Mode License,width=1200]\n\nYour license Id will be written out to the CleanSpeak configuration file in case you need to change it in the future.\n\nIn the next step of Maintenance Mode you will see a screen like this:\n\nimage::maintenance-mode-database.png[Maintenance Mode Database,width=1200]\n\nYou will need to confirm the database server name, port, database type and database name are all correct. Below these fields are the super user username and password credentials. You need to supply CleanSpeak with the username and password for a database user that has access to create new databases and schemas. Below this section are the username and password that CleanSpeak will use to connect to the database. You should ensure that all of these fields are correct and then hit the submit button.\n\nAfter you hit submit, you should see a screen that indicates that CleanSpeak WebService is starting. After this screen disappears, CleanSpeak WebService will be fully installed, configured and running.\n\n== Advanced Installation\n\nThese instructions will assist you in editing the CleanSpeak WebService configuration file and installing the database schema via the command-line. If you used Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak WebService, you can skip this section.\n\n=== Database Schema\n\n[WARNING]\n====\n**Security**\n\nBy default, the application is configured to connect to the database named `cleanspeak` on localhost with the user name `cleanspeak` and the password `cleanspeak`. For development and testing, you can use these defaults; however, we recommend a more secure password for production systems.\n====\n\nIn the following examples, `<root_user>` is the name of the root user for your database. The `<root_user>`` must be either the root user or a user that has privileges to create databases. For MySQL, this is generally a user named 'root', on PostgreSQL, this is generally a user named 'postgres'.

<+>---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Using CleanSpeak on Docker\ndescription: Deploy and test CleanSpeak using a Docker container\n---\n\n:sectnumlevels: 0\n\n== Docker Compose\n\nAll of the CleanSpeak Docker images may be found on https://hub.docker.com/u/cleanspeak/[Docker Hub]. If you're looking for a complete configuration to get up and running quickly, use our Docker Compose example. The following is an example and it may not be the most recent version. Refer to the following link in https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-containers/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml[GitHub] to find the latest version.\n\n```\ncurl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-containers/master/docker/docker-compose.yml\ncurl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-containers/master/docker/.env\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nThe stock `.env` file will contain the following values, you will want to modify the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You will also need to ensure that you add your license key to the `LICENSE_ID` variable. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.\n\n```\nPOSTGRES_USER=postgres\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres\nDATABASE_USER=cleanspeak\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=hkaLBM3RVnyYeYeqE3WI1w2e4Avpy0Wd5O3s3\n\nES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx256m\n\nCLEANSPEAK_MEMORY=1G\n\nLICENSE_ID=\n```\n\n== Docker Services\nIn the above example configuration you will find a database, search and CleanSpeak service. Read below to better understand how each service is configured.\n\n=== Database Service\n\nAt a minimum, you wil need to either set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `db` service section, or more ideally set the value in the host environment and leave it out of the `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure the other properties fit your requirements. Refer to the link:system-requirements[System Requirements] for database version support.\n\n=== Search Service\n\nWe currently are only supporting Elasticsearch 6.3.1, do not modify the image value. Let us know if you have a requirement for a different version of Elasticsearch. The remainder of the properties can be changed to whatever you need.\n\nIf you would like to add additional search nodes, simply copy and paste the service section named `search1` and create as many as you'd like naming them `search2`, `search3` for example. Each will require a named volume, you may increment the name of the volume as well, for example `es_data1`, `es_data2`, `es_data3`, etc.\n\n=== CleanSpeak Management Interface Service\n\n\n\n==== Silent Configuration\nAll of the environment variables are options, if not provided a default will be utilized. If you wish to perform a silent configuration which means you will not stop in maintenance mode to configure the database or search engine, you must provide the following environment variables:\n\n* `DATABASE_URL`\n* `DATABASE_ROOT_USER`\n* `SEARCH_SERVERS`\n* `LICENSE_ID`\n\nThese four variables when configured correctly will allow CleanSpeak to silently configure itself and go directly to the setup wizard. If they are omitted, CleanSpeak will start up in Maintenance mode and require you to interactively configure the database and search engine.\n\n==== Configuration\nReview the following environment variables to customize your deployment.\n\n[cols=\"3a,7a\"]\n[.api]\n.Environment Variables\n|===\n|DATABASE_URL [optional]#Optional#\n|The JDBC URL that CleanSpeak can use to connect to the configured database.\n\nConsider the example below and review each part of the URL string as you may need to adjust it for your configuration.\n\n[block-quote]#jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/cleanspeak#\n\n* Database type: PostgreSQL\n* Database host: db\n* Database port: 5432\n* Database name: cleanspeak\n\nIn the example above, notice we have specified the PostgreSQL jdbc type, a host of `db`, a port `5432` and a database name of `cleanspeak`. The host is the service name of the database configuration, in this case it is named `db`.\n\nYou may also wish to connect to a remote database, in that case you will provide your own JDBC string URL and you will not require the `db` service in your configuration.\n\nSetting this environment variable will override the `database.url` in the Configuration file. See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n|DATABASE_ROOT_USER [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `postgres` (The default for the postgres image)#\n|The database root user that is used to create the CleanSpeak schema and CleanSpeak user.\n\nOnce CleanSpeak is configured and running this value is no longer used and is never persisted.\n\n|DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `postgres` (The default for the postgres image)#\n|The database root password that is used to create the CleanSpeak schema and CleanSpeak user. It is recommended to leave the value of this variable empty as it is shown in the example. Using this configuration, the value will be picked up from the host environment. To use the value in this way, be sure to set this named environment value before calling `docker-compose up`.\n\nOnce CleanSpeak is configured and running this value is no longer used and is never persisted.\n\n|DATABASE_USER [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `cleanspeak`#\n|The database user that will be created during configuration to own the CleanSpeak schema and to connect to the database at CleanSpeak runtime.\n\nSetting this environment variable will override the `database.username` in the Configuration file. See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n|DATABASE_PASSWORD [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `cleanspeak`#\n|The database password that will be created during configuration to own the CleanSpeak schema and to connect to the database at CleanSpeak runtime. If you are deploying this into production it is extremely important that you sent this value to something other than the default.\n\nSetting this environment variable will override the `database.password` in the Configuration file. See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n|CLEANSPEAK_MEMORY [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `256M`#\n|The RAM to assign to the Java VM for CleanSpeak.\n\nSetting this environment variable will override the `cleanspeak-*.memory` in the Configuration file. See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n|SEARCH_SERVERS [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `http://localhost:9021`#\n|A comma separated listed of URLs to connect to one or more search servers.\n\nSetting this environment variable will override the `cleanspeak.search-servers` in the Configuration file. See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n|LICENSE_ID [optional]#Optional#\n|Your License ID. You can find your License ID by logging into your account at https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/.\n\n|===\n\n== Production Deployment\n\nElasticsearch has a few runtime requirements that may not be met by default on your host platform. Please review the Elasticsearch Docker production mode guide for more information.\n\n* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode\n\nFor example if startup is failing and you see the following in the logs, you will need to increase `vm.max_map_count` on your host VM.\n\n[.blockquote]\n----\n2018-11-22T12:32:06.779828954Z Nov 22, 2018 12:32:06.779 PM ERROR c.inversoft.maintenance.search.ElasticsearchSilentConfigurationWorkflowTask\n  - Silent configuration was unable to complete search configuration.

<+>---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: CleanSpeak System Requirements\ndescription: Server and third party software requirements necessary to run CleanSpeak\n---\n\n=== Hardware Sizing\nCleanSpeak is an efficient high performance piece of software. The main factor in determining your hardware needs is whether you will be storing content or not. When you store content you'll need to properly size the system to manage the database load. The hardware requirements depend on the server load which is primarily impacted by the volume of content being filtered and persisted by CleanSpeak and the number of moderators you'll have logged into the CleanSpeak Management Interface searching content and taking moderation actions.\n\nIf you do not intend to store content, which means you'll either be using the link:../apis/content#filtering-content[Filter Content API] or will be configuring your CleanSpeak Application to not store content, the database and disk speeds are not crucial to performance of CleanSpeak. With this type of usage you may choose to run the database and all of the CleanSpeak web services on the same system. Be aware that running all services on the same system does present a single point of failure in your architecture.\n\n*CleanSpeak Resource Usage Overview:*\n\n* CPU: When running on bare metal any modern CPU (Dual Core) or better will be sufficient. CPU load will increase with content volume. When sizing virtual CPUs in a cloud configuration 2 virtual CPUs are adequate for most configurations. Because there is no standard of what constitutes a virtual processor in cloud terminology it is difficult to make a specific recommendation. In our experience 2 vCPU is adequate.\n* Memory: The size and complexity of the filter will impact the amount of RAM necessary to run CleanSpeak. Each service runs in a separate Java VM and thus requires a minimum amount of RAM to start up. If you'll be running all of the CleanSpeak services on the same system, 2 GB of RAM is the minimum required. 4 GB is recommended.\n* Disk: The size of disk storage required is primarily dictated by the size of the database. If you'll be installing the database on a separate server from the other CleanSpeak services a 20 GB disk is sufficient. If you'll be persisting content, the server where the database is installed should have a minimum of 64 GB of storage and you should favor SSD disks whenever possible. You will also need to increase your database server specs as the amount of content you will be persisting increases.\n\n*Variables to consider:*\n\n* How much content will you be persisting and for how long? The size of your database will directly be impacted by these variables. Is this bare metal or virtualized in AWS or another cloud provider? Network and storage performance can be very low on virtualized resources. Specifically IOPS can be much lower on a virtualized servers than on bare metal servers.\n* Does the database server have adequate RAM to keep all indexes in memory? As the size of your database grows the size of the indexes will increase. Once they cannot fit into RAM the database performance will suffer drastically.\n\n==== AWS Considerations\nWhen running CleanSpeak in a cloud environment such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) be aware that virtualized storage access and shared CPUs can be slower than bare metal. For a production deployment we recommend an `m3.large` EC2 instance as a minimum. If you're deploying development and staging environments CleanSpeak will run fine on a `m3.medium` albeit a bit slower.\n\n=== Operating System\nCleanSpeak is capable of running on most modern operating systems. Below is a list of the supported operating systems.\n\n* Linux - all distributions (64-bit)\n* Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) or newer\n* Windows Server 2008 SP2 (64-bit) w/ Windows Management Framework 3.0 or newer\n* Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit) w/ Windows Management Framework 3.0 or newer\n* Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit) w/ Windows Management Framework 3.0 or newer\n\nMany other operating systems are capable of running the CleanSpeak, but are not officially supported. Any operating system capable of running Java version 1.8 or higher should be capable of running CleanSpeak.\n\n=== Java\nIf you install CleanSpeak via the ZIP package prior to version 3.1.4, you must install Java JDK 1.8 manually. If you're using CleanSpeak version 3.1.4 or later, Java is bundled in the downloaded package and there is no additional configuration required.\n\n* Version 3.32.0 and beyond will download and utilize Java 17\n* Versions 3.30.0 to 3.31.4 will download and utilize Java 14\n* Anything older than version 3.30.0 will run on Java 8\n\n=== Database\nCleanSpeak supports the following two databases.\n\n* MySQL 5.7 or later.\n* PostgreSQL 10 or later\n\n=== Availability\nIf you're planning your architecture for high availability, we recommend separating the CleanSpeak web services and database onto different servers. CleanSpeak is comprised of a database and three web services: the Search Engine, WebService (API) and the Management Interface. Each of these components communicates through a network connection so they can run on the same server or separate servers to accommodate availability requirements.\n\nA common enterprise topology example is provided below. In this example a load balancer is used to distribute the API requests between two instances of the CleanSpeak WebService. Each WebService and Management Interface server has a connection to the same database. Only one server is running the CleanSpeak Management Interface as this service does not usually need to be redundant. The CleanSpeak Management Interface is how CleanSpeak is configured and also how moderators manage content and users. If this crashes, most companies can simply restart the server and manage a small amount of downtime. Not that the CleanSpeak WebService, where all the filtering logic resides and this is also where your application will integrate with CleanSpeak, will continue to operate even if the CleanSpeak Management Interface is not available. The database can be clustered or if you're using something like Amazon RDS, there is some inherent redundancy already built into the system.\n\nCleanSpeak utilizes Elastic Search which natively supports clustering. This service may also be horizontally scaled for redundancy and performance reasons.\n\nimage:install-guide-availability-architecture.png[Enterprise Architecture]\n

<+>---\nlayout: doc\ntitle: Management Interface Installation\ndescription: Install the CleanSpeak Management Interface bundle that allows you to configure CleanSpeak and moderate your content and users\n---\n\n== Download the Packages\n\nThis guide will assist you with installing CleanSpeak Management Interface on your own server (Linux, Mac OS, or Windows) and also works equally well for development environments.\n\nLog into the CleanSpeak website at https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/ and navigate to the Licenses section and click on Download CleanSpeak. You will need to download one of the CleanSpeak Management Interface package that matches the operating system you will be installing CleanSpeak on.\n\n== Red Hat\n\nTo install on a Red Hat system (including Fedora and CentOS), use the RPM bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak Management Interface RPM (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ sudo rpm -i cleanspeak-management-interface-<version>.rpm\n----\n\n== Debian\n\nTo install on a Debian system (including Ubuntu, Mint and Debian base), use the DEB bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak Management Interface DEB (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ sudo dpkg -i cleanspeak-management-interface-<version>.deb\n----\n\n== Mac OS X\n\nTo install on Mac OS use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak Management Interface ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `/usr/local/inversoft`.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nYou can install CleanSpeak in any directory including your home directory. This is a good choice for development machines or when you don't have or want to use sudo to install CleanSpeak.\n====\n\nOnce the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n/usr/local/inversoft/config\n/usr/local/inversoft/config/keystore\n/usr/local/inversoft/config/cleanspeak.properties\n/usr/local/inversoft/cleanspeak-management-interface\n----\n\n== Windows\n\nTo install on Windows 7 or higher use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak Management Interface ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `C:\\inversoft` on Windows.\n\nOnce the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\nC:\\inversoft\\config\nC:\\inversoft\\config\\keystore\nC:\\inversoft\\config\\cleanspeak.properties\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-management-interface\\\n----\n\nNext, install the Windows service by changing to the directory you installed CleanSpeak (i.e. `C:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-management-interface\\apache-tomcat\\bin`) and then running the install command. Here are those two steps:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\nC:\\>cd C:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-management-interface\\apache-tomcat\\bin\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-management-interface\\apache-tomcat\\bin>CleanSpeakManagementInterface.exe /install\n----\n\n== Service Name\n\nAs long as your installation method installed CleanSpeak Management Interface as a service, the service name will be as follows:\n\n[cols=\"4h,6m\"]\n|===\n|Service Name\n|cleanspeak-management-interface\n|===\n\nYou can use the operating system commands to start, stop and check the status of CleanSpeak using this service name.\n\n== Start CleanSpeak Management Interface\n\nNext, you need to start CleanSpeak Management Interface so that you can enter Maintenance Mode and allow CleanSpeak to create the database. Use the instructions below to start CleanSpeak based on the platform you installed it on. Also note that the `CLEANSPEAK_HOME` directory is the location you installed CleanSpeak Management Interface to.\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nMaintenance Mode makes installation simple. However, sometimes it is not possible to use Maintenance Mode. For example, if you are doing an unattended install to a server. You can edit the CleanSpeak configuration files and install the database schema via the command-line using the <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> instructions below.\n\nIf you do not use Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak, do not start CleanSpeak at this point. Instead, skip the to <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> section and then return to this section after you have configured CleanSpeak and the database via the command-line.\n====\n\n\n[source,shell]\n.Linux (RPM or DEB package)\n----\n$ sudo service cleanspeak-management-interface start\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Mac OS X (ZIP package)\n----\n$ <CLEANSPEAK_HOME>/cleanspeak-management-interface/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Windows (ZIP package)\n----\nC:\\inversoft\\cleanspeak-management-interface\\apache-tomcat\\bin>startup.bat\n----\n\n[source,shell]\n.Windows Service\n----\nC:\\> net start CleanSpeakManagementInterface\n----\n\n== Maintenance Mode\n\nYou will access CleanSpeak Management Interface's Maintenance Mode setup via the browser. If you installed CleanSpeak Management Interface on your local machine, you'll access this interface by opening http://localhost:8011 in your browser. If CleanSpeak is running on a remote server, change the server name in the URL to match your server's name.\n\nThe first step of Maintenance Mode will prompt you to enter your license Id. You can retrieve your license Id from the CleanSpeak website by logging into your account here: https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/\n\nYou should see a screen that looks like this:\n\nimage::maintenance-mode-license.png[Maintenance Mode License Page,width=1200]\n\nYour license Id will be written out to the CleanSpeak configuration file in case you need to change it in the future.\n\nIn the next step of Maintenance Mode you will see a screen like this:\n\nimage::maintenance-mode-database.png[Maintenance Mode Database Page,width=1200]\n\nYou will need to confirm the database server name, port, database type and database name are all correct. Below these fields are the super user username and password credentials. You need to supply CleanSpeak with the username and password for a database user that has access to create new databases and schemas. Below this section are the username and password that CleanSpeak will use to connect to the database. You should ensure that all of these fields are correct and then hit the submit button.\n\nAfter you hit submit, you should see a screen that indicates that CleanSpeak Management Interface is starting. After this screen disappears, CleanSpeak Management Interface will be fully installed, configured and running.\n\n== Advanced Installation\n\nThese instructions will assist you in editing the CleanSpeak Management Interface configuration file and installing the database schema via the command-line. If you used Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak Management Interface, you can skip this section.\n\n=== Database Schema\n\n[WARNING]\n====\n**Security**\n\nBy default, the application is configured to connect to the database named `cleanspeak` on localhost with the user name `cleanspeak` and the password `cleanspeak`. For development and testing, you can use these defaults; however, we recommend a more secure password for production systems.\n====\n\nIn the following examples, `<root_user>` is the name of the root user for your database. The `<root_user>`` must be either the root user or a user that has privileges to create databases. For MySQL, this is generally a user named 'root', on PostgreSQL, this is generally a user named 'postgres'. Run the following SQL commands to configure the database for use by CleanSpeak.\n\n[source,shell]\n.MySQL\n----\n# Create the cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.\nmysql --default-character-set=utf8 -u<root_user> -e \"create database cleanspeak character set = 'utf8mb4' collate = 'utf8mb4_bin';\"\n\n# Grant cleanspeak all authority to cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.\nmysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -u<root_user> -e \"grant all on cleanspeak.* to 'cleanspeak'@'localhost' identified by 'cleanspeak'\" cleanspeak\n\n# Create CleanSpeak schema, run this command from the directory where you have extracted the CleanSpeak Database Schema zip\nmysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -ucleanspeak -pcleanspeak cleanspeak < mysql.sql\n----\n\n*_Note:* MySQL version 8 is not yet supported._\n\n[source,shell]\n.PostgreSQL\n----\n# Create the cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.\npsql -U<root_user> -c \"CREATE DATABASE cleanspeak ENCODING 'UTF-8' LC_CTYPE 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_COLLATE 'en_US.UTF-8' TEMPLATE template0\"\n\n# Note, if installing on Windows, the Encoding values are different, replace the previous command with this version.\npsql -U<root_user> -c \"CREATE DATABASE cleanspeak ENCODING 'UTF-8' LC_CTYPE 'English_United States' LC_COLLATE 'English_United States' TEMPLATE template0;\"\n\n# Grant cleanspeak all authority to cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> and <password> with valid superuser credentials.\npsql -U<root_user> -c \"CREATE ROLE cleanspeak WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cleanspeak TO cleanspeak; ALTER DATABASE cleanspeak OWNER TO cleanspeak;\"\n\n# Create CleanSpeak schema, run this command from the directory where you have extracted the CleanSpeak Database Schema zip\npsql -Ucleanspeak cleanspeak < postgresql.sql\n----\n\n=== Configuration\n\nBefore starting CleanSpeak Management Interface for the first time, you'll need to add your license Id and verify your database connection in the the CleanSpeak configuration. The name of this file is `cleanspeak.properties`.\n\nThe configuration file may be found in the following directory, assuming you installed in the default locations. If you have installed in an alternate location, the path to this file will be different.\n\nWindows::\n  `C:\\inversoft\\config`\n\nMac OS X or Linux::\n  `/usr/local/inversoft/config`\n\nFor more information about the other configuration options found in this file, see the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] section.\n\nFind the license Id field at the top of this configuration file and enter your license Id. You can find your License Id by logging into your account at https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/.\n\n[source,ini]\n.License Id\n----\nlicense.id=\n----\n\nFind the default database JDBC url, username and password values, verify this information is correct. The default JDBC url is configured for MySQL, if you're using PostgreSQL you'll need to update the URL. See the `database.url` property documentation in link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.\n\n[source,ini]\n.Database Configuration\n----\ndatabase.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cleanspeak\ndatabase.username=cleanspeak\ndatabase.password=cleanspeak\n----\n\nCleanSpeak Management Interface should now be configured, the database should be created and everything should be ready to run. You can start CleanSpeak Management Interface using the instructions in the <<Start CleanSpeak Management Interface>> section above.

Need to filter in another language? Let us know so we can build it for you.\n\n== Overview\n\nCleanSpeak has a few concepts that are helpful to understand before beginning your integration.\n\n=== Applications\n\nA CleanSpeak Application defines a content source. Defining multiple applications allow you to customize filter behavior for each content source. For example, username filtering has a different set of requirements than filtering chat.\n\nFor example, a corporate client filtering internal customer records may define a single application named *Customer Records*. A game company that has in-game chat and a user forum may define three applications: *Game Chat*, *Forum* and *Usernames*.\n\n=== Content Users\n\nA Content User is someone that generates content that is sent to CleanSpeak for moderation. Content Users are identified by an id (specifically a UUID). A Content User may not log into CleanSpeak.\n\n=== System Users\n\nA System User is either a CleanSpeak moderator or admin user. These users may log into the CleanSpeak Management Interface. An admin user can modify permissions assigned to moderators to limit their access and privilege in the CleanSpeak Management Interface.\n\n== Getting Started\n\nGetting started with CleanSpeak depends on the version of CleanSpeak you are using. Use the information in the appropriate section below based on your version of CleanSpeak.\n\n=== CleanSpeak Cloud\n\nCleanSpeak Cloud is a hosted solution that is maintained and monitored by Inversoft. When you sign up for CleanSpeak Cloud, Inversoft provisions a Private Cloud Server for you in our Cloud environment. You don't need to download or install CleanSpeak if you are using this version. Once your CleanSpeak Cloud server is setup, you can immediately access it and begin your integration.\n\nHere are some common steps you'll take to get CleanSpeak Cloud configured and integrate your application with it.\n\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/setup-wizard[Setup Wizard]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/configure-an-application[Configure an Application]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/filtering-content[Filtering Content]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/handling-flags[Handling Flags]\n* [Tech Docs] link:../apis/[API docs]\n\n=== CleanSpeak Server\n\nCleanSpeak Server is an on-premise solution that is downloaded and installed on your servers. You can install and configure CleanSpeak however you want and can also put CleanSpeak behind a firewall or VPN. This solution requires that you download and install CleanSpeak yourself as well as maintain and monitor it as well.\n\nHere are some common steps you'll take to get CleanSpeak Cloud configured and integrate your application with it.\n\n* [Tech Docs] link:../installation-guide/system-requirements[Installation Guide]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/setup-wizard[Setup Wizard]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/configure-an-application[Configure an Application]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/filtering-content[Filtering Content]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/handling-flags[Handling Flags]\n* [Tech Docs] link:../apis/[API docs]\n\n=== Mobile Integrations\n\nIf you are using CleanSpeak for a mobile application that has user-generated content, you will need to use 2 different APIs to comply with Apple's and Google's requirements to be approved for the App Store and Play Store. You will also need to write an event Handler and enable User Actions in your CleanSpeak deployment. This will allow you to cover all of these requirements:\n\n* Filter user-generated content for appropriate language, racial slurs, bullying, or other offensive content\n* Allow users to report inappropriate user-generated content of other users\n* Have a method for deleting inappropriate content (via Webhooks)\n* Have a method for disabling user accounts that are generating the inappropriate content (via Webooks)\n\nHere are the APIs you will need to use as well as the features of CleanSpeak that cover all of these requirements:\n\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/setup-wizard[Setup Wizard]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/configure-an-application[Configure an Application]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/filtering-content[Filtering Content]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/handling-flags[Handling Flags]\n* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/handling-events[Handling Events]\n* [Tech Docs] link:../apis/[API docs]\n\n=== FAQ\n\n[qanda]\nHow do I gain access to the software and my license Id?::\n  Login to our accounts section of the web site at https://account.cleanspeak.com/account/.
