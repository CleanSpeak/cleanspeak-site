      <p>"Video game developers must make note that toxicity in game communities is still an issue for our industry. Moderation systems, positive culture cultivation, and exclusion of the worst offenders is necessary to allow everyone to enjoy gaming. Management of communities is even more important with the increase in online gaming."</p>

      <h2 class="cs-features-h2">Cyberbullying</h2>
      <p>CleanSpeak has a stringent "denylist" of words associated with bullying (e.g., "fat" or "hate").  An intelligent real-time filter allows a moderator to add words and phrases to make sure it is kept up to date with current slang used by kids and teens.</p>

      <p>Preventing users from sharing account information is a security concern as well as a way to prevent paid accounts from being shared. When hosting a virtual environment targeted to kids, you are also required to take reasonable measures to prevent users from sharing personal identifiable information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. CleanSpeak makes these efforts easy.</p>
