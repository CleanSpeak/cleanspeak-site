== Overview

If you're installing CleanSpeak on your own server, use the following guide as a baseline for securing the services. Please contact
support@inversoft.com if you have additional questions.

=== Required ports
See the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information on default port configuration. The documentation below
assumes the default port configuration.

**CleanSpeak Management Interface**

To access CleanSpeak Management Interface you'll need to open port `8011`.

**CleanSpeak Webservice**

To access the CleanSpeak API you'll need to open port `8001`.

**CleanSpeak Search Engine**

Suppose CleanSpeak Search Engine is running on the same system as the CleanSpeak Management Interface or CleanSpeak Webservice. If youâ€™re only running a single instance of CleanSpeak, then no external ports should be allowed for CleanSpeak Search Engine. In this scenario, CleanSpeak Management Interface and CleanSpeak Webservice will access the Elastic Search service on port `8020` on the localhost address, and traffic to ports `8020` and `8021` can be blocked from any address with the exception of the localhost.

If CleanSpeak services are installed on multiple servers, and those servers can communicate across a private network using a site-local address, then in this scenario, you will need to allow access to ports `8020` and `8021` on the site-local IP address in addition to the localhost address.

It is not recommended to expose the CleanSpeak Search Engine service to any public network. If this is a requirement, then a firewall should be used to limit traffic based on the service's source and destination IP address.

The `8020` port is utilized by Elastic Search for internal communication, including clustering. The `8021` port is the HTTP port exposed by Elastic Search for API requests to the search index.Elastic Search for API requests to the search index.
