---

== Download the Packages

This guide will assist you with installing CleanSpeak Management Interface on your own server (Linux, Mac OS, or Windows) and also works equally well for development environments.

Log into the Inversoft website at https://account.inversoft.com/account/ and navigate to the Licenses section and click on Download CleanSpeak. You will need to download one of the CleanSpeak Management Interface package that matches the operating system you will be installing CleanSpeak on.

== Red Hat

To install on a Red Hat system (including Fedora and CentOS), use the RPM bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak Management Interface RPM (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo rpm -i cleanspeak-management-interface-<version>.rpm
----

== Debian

To install on a Debian system (including Ubuntu, Mint and Debian base), use the DEB bundle. Execute this command to install the CleanSpeak Management Interface DEB (replace `<version>` with the correct version number):

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo dpkg -i cleanspeak-management-interface-<version>.deb
----

== Mac OS X

To install on Mac OS use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak Management Interface ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `/usr/local/inversoft`.

[NOTE]
====
You can install CleanSpeak in any directory including your home directory. This is a good choice for development machines or when you don't have or want to use sudo to install CleanSpeak.
====

Once the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.

[source,shell]
----
/usr/local/inversoft/config
/usr/local/inversoft/config/keystore
/usr/local/inversoft/config/cleanspeak.properties
/usr/local/inversoft/cleanspeak-management-interface
----

== Windows

To install on Windows 7 or higher use the ZIP bundle. Extract the CleanSpeak Management Interface ZIP file anywhere on the file system. Remember where you extract the file. This location will be referred to as `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`. We suggest extracting this file to a directory such as `C:\inversoft` on Windows.

Once the zip bundle has been extracted, the directory structure should look similar to this. If you installed somewhere other the default `CLEANSPEAK_HOME`, your directory structure will be different, this is only for shown as an example.

[source,shell]
----
C:\inversoft\config
C:\inversoft\config\keystore
C:\inversoft\config\cleanspeak.properties
C:\inversoft\cleanspeak-management-interface\
----

Next, install the Windows service by changing to the directory you installed CleanSpeak (i.e. `C:\inversoft\cleanspeak-management-interface\apache-tomcat\bin`) and then running the install command. Here are those two steps:

[source,shell]
----
C:\>cd C:\inversoft\cleanspeak-management-interface\apache-tomcat\bin
C:\inversoft\cleanspeak-management-interface\apache-tomcat\bin>CleanSpeakManagementInterface.exe /install
----

== Service Name

As long as your installation method installed CleanSpeak Management Interface as a service, the service name will be as follows:

[cols="4h,6m"]
|===
|Service Name
|cleanspeak-management-interface
|===

You can use the operating system commands to start, stop and check the status of CleanSpeak using this service name.

== Start CleanSpeak Management Interface

Next, you need to start CleanSpeak Management Interface so that you can enter Maintenance Mode and allow CleanSpeak to create the database. Use the instructions below to start CleanSpeak based on the platform you installed it on. Also note that the `CLEANSPEAK_HOME` directory is the location you installed CleanSpeak Management Interface to.

[NOTE]
====
Maintenance Mode makes installation simple. However, sometimes it is not possible to use Maintenance Mode. For example, if you are doing an unattended install to a server. You can edit the CleanSpeak configuration files and install the database schema via the command-line using the <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> instructions below.

If you do not use Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak, do not start CleanSpeak at this point. Instead, skip the to <<advanced-installation,Advanced Installation>> section and then return to this section after you have configured CleanSpeak and the database via the command-line.
====


[source,shell]
.Linux (RPM or DEB package)
----
$ sudo service cleanspeak-management-interface start
----

[source,shell]
.Mac OS X (ZIP package)
----
$ <CLEANSPEAK_HOME>/cleanspeak-management-interface/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh
----

[source,shell]
.Windows (ZIP package)
----
C:\inversoft\cleanspeak-management-interface\apache-tomcat\bin>startup.bat
----

[source,shell]
.Windows Service
----
C:\> net start CleanSpeakManagementInterface
----

== Maintenance Mode

You will access CleanSpeak Management Interface's Maintenance Mode setup via the browser. If you installed CleanSpeak Management Interface on your local machine, you'll access this interface by opening http://localhost:8011 in your browser. If CleanSpeak is running on a remote server, change the server name in the URL to match your server's name.

The first step of Maintenance Mode will prompt you to enter your license Id. You can retrieve your license Id from the Inversoft website by logging into your account here: https://account.inversoft.com/account/

You should see a screen that looks like this:

image::maintenance-mode-license.png[Maintenance Mode License Page,width=1200]

Your license Id will be written out to the CleanSpeak configuration file in case you need to change it in the future.

In the next step of Maintenance Mode you will see a screen like this:

image::maintenance-mode-database.png[Maintenance Mode Database Page,width=1200]

You will need to confirm the database server name, port, database type and database name are all correct. Below these fields are the super user username and password credentials. You need to supply CleanSpeak with the username and password for a database user that has access to create new databases and schemas. Below this section are the username and password that CleanSpeak will use to connect to the database. You should ensure that all of these fields are correct and then hit the submit button.

After you hit submit, you should see a screen that indicates that CleanSpeak Management Interface is starting. After this screen disappears, CleanSpeak Management Interface will be fully installed, configured and running.

== Advanced Installation

These instructions will assist you in editing the CleanSpeak Management Interface configuration file and installing the database schema via the command-line. If you used Maintenance Mode to configure CleanSpeak Management Interface, you can skip this section.

=== Database Schema

[WARNING]
====
**Security**

By default, the application is configured to connect to the database named `cleanspeak` on localhost with the user name `cleanspeak` and the password `cleanspeak`. For development and testing, you can use these defaults; however, we recommend a more secure password for production systems.
====

In the following examples, `<root_user>` is the name of the root user for your database. The `<root_user>`` must be either the root user or a user that has privileges to create databases. For MySQL, this is generally a user named 'root', on PostgreSQL, this is generally a user named 'postgres'. Run the following SQL commands to configure the database for use by CleanSpeak.

[source,shell]
.MySQL
----
# Create the cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.
mysql --default-character-set=utf8 -u<root_user> -e "create database cleanspeak character set = 'utf8mb4' collate = 'utf8mb4_bin';"

# Grant cleanspeak all authority to cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.
mysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -u<root_user> -e "grant all on cleanspeak.* to 'cleanspeak'@'localhost' identified by 'cleanspeak'" cleanspeak

# Create CleanSpeak schema, run this command from the directory where you have extracted the CleanSpeak Database Schema zip
mysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -ucleanspeak -pcleanspeak cleanspeak < mysql.sql
----

*_Note:* MySQL version 8 is not yet supported._

[source,shell]
.PostgreSQL
----
# Create the cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> a valid superuser.
psql -U<root_user> -c "CREATE DATABASE cleanspeak ENCODING 'UTF-8' LC_CTYPE 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_COLLATE 'en_US.UTF-8' TEMPLATE template0"

# Note, if installing on Windows, the Encoding values are different, replace the previous command with this version.
psql -U<root_user> -c "CREATE DATABASE cleanspeak ENCODING 'UTF-8' LC_CTYPE 'English_United States' LC_COLLATE 'English_United States' TEMPLATE template0;"

# Grant cleanspeak all authority to cleanspeak database, replace <root_user> and <password> with valid superuser credentials.
psql -U<root_user> -c "CREATE ROLE cleanspeak WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cleanspeak TO cleanspeak; ALTER DATABASE cleanspeak OWNER TO cleanspeak;"

# Create CleanSpeak schema, run this command from the directory where you have extracted the CleanSpeak Database Schema zip
psql -Ucleanspeak cleanspeak < postgresql.sql
----

=== Configuration

Before starting CleanSpeak Management Interface for the first time, you'll need to add your license Id and verify your database connection in the the CleanSpeak configuration. The name of this file is `cleanspeak.properties`.

The configuration file may be found in the following directory, assuming you installed in the default locations. If you have installed in an alternate location, the path to this file will be different.

Windows::
  `C:\inversoft\config`

Mac OS X or Linux::
  `/usr/local/inversoft/config`

For more information about the other configuration options found in this file, see the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] section.

Find the license Id field at the top of this configuration file and enter your license Id. You can find your License Id by logging into your account at https://account.inversoft.com/account/.

[source,ini]
.License Id
----
license.id=
----

Find the default database JDBC url, username and password values, verify this information is correct. The default JDBC url is configured for MySQL, if you're using PostgreSQL you'll need to update the URL. See the `database.url` property documentation in link:../reference/configuration[Configuration Reference] for more information.

[source,ini]
.Database Configuration
----
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cleanspeak
database.username=cleanspeak
database.password=cleanspeak
----

CleanSpeak Management Interface should now be configured, the database should be created and everything should be ready to run. You can start CleanSpeak Management Interface using the instructions in the <<Start CleanSpeak Management Interface>> section above.
