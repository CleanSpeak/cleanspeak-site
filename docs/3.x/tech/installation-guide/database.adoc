== Database Installation

[NOTE]
====
If you already have a MySQL or PostgreSQL database installed that you will be using with CleanSpeak, you can skip this section completely.
====

To use CleanSpeak, you need to install a database. The database requirements are listed above. You can use CleanSpeak with either MySQL or PostgreSQL. Follow the instructions below to install a supported database.

[NOTE]
====
You only need to install either MySQL or PostgreSQL to use CleanSpeak.
====

=== Install MySQL

If you want to use MySQL for your database, you will need to install version `5.5.3` or later. Depending on your operating system, you can download and install MySQL or use the operating systems package management tools. Use the instructions below to install MySQL based on your operating system.

==== Linux

To install MySQL on a Linux system, you can use the apt or yum tools depending on whether or not your Linux distribution is based on Red Hat or Debian. The package name may vary depending on your platform, for example, `MySQL-server` or `MySQL-server-5.5`. Here are the commands for each:

[source,shell]
.Red Hat
----
$ yum install mysql-server
----

[source,shell]
.Debian
----
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
----

==== Windows or Mac OSX

If you are installing MySQL on a platform that does not support RPM or DEB packages, you will need to download it manually from the MySQL website here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql

==== MySQL and Unicode

[NOTE]
====
To properly store 4 byte unicode, the character set must be set to `utf8mb4`.

By default this configuration is enforced during startup. If CleanSpeak fails to startup due to this validation the log will contain detailed
messages about the MySQL configuration.

It is recommended to ensure you have properly configured MySQL to use `utf8mb4` before attempting to startup CleanSpeak. Please verify you have
the following configuration in your `my.cnf` file. On Windows the file is called `my.ini`.

If you need to modify your configuration, restart MySQL for the changes to take effect.
====

[source,ini]
.my.cnf
----
[client]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_bin
----

This is a system-wide configuration option, so be certain that this change wonâ€™t impact other databases and applications on the same MySQL server. Not all of these configuration options may be available, depending on your database configuration. Once you have configured the available options, you may disable this feature if the startup still fails due to this validation. See `database.mysql.enforce-utf8mb4` in the link:../reference/configuration[Configuration] reference.


=== Installing PostgreSQL

==== Linux

To install PostgreSQL on a Linux system, you can use the apt or yum tools depending on whether or not your Linux distribution is based on Red Hat or Debian. The package name may vary depending on your platform.

[source,shell]
.Red Hat
----
$ sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql
$ sudo yum install postgresql9-contrib.x86_64
----

[source,shell]
.Debian
----
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-server
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
----

==== Windows or macOS

If you are installing PostgreSQL on a platform that does not support RPM or DEB packages, you will need to manually download it from the PostgreSQL website here: https://www.postgresql.org
