== Exporting Lists
Note: Making changes to your lists after exporting will cause issues when importing.


You may be asked by our support team to export your lists and configurations so that we can test it on our end.
Maybe you're moving lists between systems, or you're doing an upgrade and you want to backup your CleanSpeak DB.
Here we will show you how to quickly and easily export your lists and configurations in CleanSpeak.


From the moderator dashboard you will click on the filter drop down found in the left navigation.

At the very bottom of the drop down you will find the lists button.

Here we see our Blacklist and kids chat list.
You will then click on the export button found near the right corner.
