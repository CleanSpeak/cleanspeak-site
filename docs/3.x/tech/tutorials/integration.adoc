== Default Filter Lists

You can import any number of languages you want for your instance, it is however only recommended that you use the language
that bulk of your users speak and use, this is because many languages have overlapping words that are not vulgar in one but
offensive in another. For example importing both French and English would result in the word "Pine" being filtered out as
it is offensive in French.

In order to import lists you can click setup on the Dashboard in the Missing Lists card or you can navigate to Filters -> Lists -> Import (Button in the top right) to
reach this in the future.
