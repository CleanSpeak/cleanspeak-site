== Default Filter Lists

You can import any number of languages you want for your instance. It is however only recommended that you use the language that the bulk of your users speak and use. This is because many languages have overlapping words that are not vulgar in one but offensive in another. For example, importing both French and English would result in the word "Pine" being filtered out as it is offensive in French.

To import lists, you can click setup on the Dashboard in the Missing Lists card or navigate to [breadcrumb]#Filters → Lists → Import# (Button in the top right) to reach this in the future.

== API Keys

To make calls to CleanSpeak, you will need an API Key. These keys allow REST calls to be authenticated and give them controlled access to CleanSpeak APIs.

See [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys#
