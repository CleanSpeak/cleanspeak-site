In order to ensure that you have permissions to use the Setup Wizard, you must copy your license id into this page. You can find your license id by logging into your Inversoft account at https://account.inversoft.com/account/.

The rest of the Setup Wizard is fairly self-explanatory. Keep in mind that everything configured on this page can be changed later.
