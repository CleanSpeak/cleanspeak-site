== Prometheus Setup

[NOTE.since]
====
Available since `3.25.0`
====

Prometheus is a tool to monitor metrics and setup alerts in the case that some metric has responded negatively for an extended period. Setting this up with CleanSpeak is easy.

=== Setup

The primary requirement to hookup CleanSpeak is to direct Prometheus to the CleanSpeak endpoints. We used the following configuration for a CleanSpeak instance running locally on the docker host. (You can reach the docker host using the hostname `host.docker.internal` on macOS and Windows. By default, for 4.x, CleanSpeak runs on `8001` and for 3.x the CleanSpeak Management Interface runs on `8011` and CleanSpeak Webservice runs on `8001`)

[source,yaml]
.prometheus.yaml (3x)

[source,yaml]
.prometheus.yaml (4x)
----
include::docs/4.x/tech/src/yaml/prometheus.yaml[]
----


[NOTE]
====
in 4.x, you must either supply an API key as the example above does OR connect from localhost with `cleanspeak-app.local-metrics.enabled` in the config file
====


We then started prometheus with
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yaml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
