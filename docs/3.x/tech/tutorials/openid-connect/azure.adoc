== Configure OpenID with Azure

Azure OpenID has a slightly different workflow because it uses a slightly different path for the issuer. This is because Azure uses tenant specific OpenID URLs.

=== First we again need to create an application.
.. First navigate to your portal
.. Open `Azure Active Directory`
.. Open `App registrations` on the new inner left menu. (The screen should look like the image below)

.. Click `New registration`
.. Choose a name and set the redirect URI
+

.. Click register

=== You should now see a screen like the following.

=== Now open CleanSpeak System Settings
.. Paste `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}` into the issuer field of your. (With `{tenantId}` replaced with your own)
.. Copy the Client ID from your azure application and paste that in the Client ID field of CleanSpeak

=== Now we need a client secret (which is required for all web based applications on Azure)
.. Go to your Azure app
.. Open certificates and secrets
.. Click `New client secret`
.. Choose a name for this secret and create it
.. Copy the secret value to your CleanSpeak OpenID Settings
.. Click save

=== You can now login with Azure
