.Request Body
|===
|[field]#content# [type]#[Object]# [required]#Required#
|The piece of content being moderated.

|[field]#content.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#
|The Id of the application that corresponds to the content source.

|[field]#content.createInstant# [type]#[Long]# [required]#Required#
|The link:../reference/data-types#instants[instant] that the content was generated. *NOTE*: this is represented as milliseconds since Epoch.

|[field]#content.location# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|Specifies the location within the application that the content was generated. For example, you might use a chat room name, area Id for a game, or a thread Id for a forum. This parameter is used by CleanSpeak to display conversational views of content with the Context View feature. You can find more on this in  See link:docs/3.x/tech/apis/content#filter-content[Moderate Content].

|[field]#content.parts# [type]#[Array]# [required]#Required#
|An array that contains one to many content parts. If your content only has a single part, such as a chat message, the array will only contain a single text entry. The reason you would send in multiple content parts within a single request is to ensure the moderation decision affects each part.

For example, you may send in an image for moderation, the image has a title and a description field. You would send this to CleanSpeak with three content parts, the image and two text parts. If the content of the image title is rejected the entire content needs to be rejected wholesale, the title, description and the image. In this case it would make sense to treat all three parts as an atomic unit of content.

If individual content parts are not related and can be rejected or approved separately then you should send them to CleanSpeak as separate requests.

|[field]#content.parts``[x]``.content# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The content to be filtered. The content type will indicate what type of content is expected in this parameter.
