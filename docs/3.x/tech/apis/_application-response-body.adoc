|A flag to enable all matches to be kept. This is useful if `keepAdditionalContentPercent` is less than `1.0` so that you can ensure that you are always keeping content that was matched on.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.approvalCheckOutMinutes# [type]#[Integer]#
|The number of minutes content is checked out for in the Approval Queue before it is automatically released to be eligible for another moderator to check out.

|Setting this value to true enables content deletion. This is false by default which means no content is deleted. If you'll be sending in high volumes of content content deletion should be enabled. CleanSpeak is not designed to store content indefinitely.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.archiveConfiguration.storeDuration# [type]#[Integer]#
|The number of units content should be kept. The unit value is determined by the `storeTimeUnit`.

* did not match any filter rules, but the moderate request parameter for `moderation` is set to `generateAlert` or `generatesContentAlert`, [underline]#do not# queue for approval.
* did match one or more filters with an action other than `allow`, [underline]#do not# queue for approval.

This feature may be used way to ensure all content is reviewed in some fashion by a moderator.

|This parameter specifies a penalty that is applied to the quality score for a match if it contains any type of separator other than a dash or parenthesis. For example, `303;555;1234` contains two penalized separators so the separator penalty will be multiplied by the number of separators and added to the quality score.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.phoneNumberFilterSpacePenalty# [type]#[Double]#
|This parameter specifies a penalty that is applied to the quality score for a match if it contains one or more spaces. For example, `303 555 1234` contains two spaces so the space penalty will be multiplied by the number of spaces and added to the quality score.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.phoneNumberFilterWordPenalty# [type]#[Double]#
|This parameter specifies a penalty that is applied to the quality score for a match if it contains any words rather than digits. For example, `three zero three 555 1234` contains three words so the word penalty will be multiplied by the number of words and added to the quality score.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.phoneNumberRules# [type]#[Array<<<Quality Filter Rule>>>]#
|The phone number filter rules. [underline]#You must supply exactly three rules.# Each rule must provide a `score` value which is the inclusive cutoff score for a phone number match.

A special condition is that the final unicode range may be an open range meaning the second unicode point is omitted.

Note: The ranges are inclusive so \u0000-\u000F includes the character \u000F

Note 2: The provided config may change between versions.

|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.urlFilterMaxLength# [type]#[Integer]#
