== Authentication

CleanSpeak controls access to the API through the use of an API Key. By default all APIs will return an `401` Unauthorized response.

To enable access to the API create one or more API Keys in the CleanSpeak Management Interface. The API Key is then supplied in the HTTP request using the `Authorization` header.

The following example demonstrates the HTTP `Authorization` header with an API Key of `2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013`.

[source,properties]
----
Authorization: 2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013
----

The following is a cURL example using the `Authorization` header.
[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'Authorization: 2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013' https://example-cleanspeak-api.io/content/item/filter
