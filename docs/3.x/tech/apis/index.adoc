== Overview

CleanSpeak provides a number of `APIs` that allow you to integrate your application with CleanSpeak. All of the CleanSpeak `APIs` are `RESTful` and return `JSON`. This means that you will contact the `API` using the standard `HTTP` protocol.

The CleanSpeak `APIs` are also synchronous. When you call an `API`, CleanSpeak will process the request and then immediately return a response. This allows you to use CleanSpeak for real-time applications such as filtering chat before it is displayed.

There are 7 primary groups of `APIs`:

* link:admins-moderators[Admins/Moderators] - These are system level `APIs` that allows you to manage CleanSpeak Moderators and Administrators.
* link:applications[Applications] - These are system level `APIs` that allows you to manage filter rules for content different sources.
* link:blacklist[Blacklist] - These `APIs` allow you to modify the blacklist filter behavior.
* link:content[Content] - These `APIs` are the primary integration point where you will send content to be filtered, analyzed and moderated.
* link:kids-chat[Kids Chat] - These `APIs` allow you to download the whitelist for use in auto-correct or suggestion features of your application.
* link:url[URL] - These `APIs` allow you to control the URL filter state.
* link:users[Users] - These `APIs` are the secondary integration point where you will manage your end-users that are generating content.
* link:status[Status] - This `API` provides you status information about CleanSpeak.
* link:system[System] - These are system level `APIs` that allows you to backup and restore CleanSpeak data.
