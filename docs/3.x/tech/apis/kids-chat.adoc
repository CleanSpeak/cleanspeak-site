description: Whitelist APIs that allow your application to access the whitelist allowed words which can be used for suggestion widgets

== Overview

[NOTE.info]
--
The Whitelist is known as the Kids Chat on the frontend. In this document it will still be referred to as the Whitelist.
--

These APIs allow you to query and modify the Whitelist filter state.

The Whitelist is best understood as a deny first list of words people are allowed to use. Only when a user has matched an allowed word or phrase will the content be permitted. The Whitelist also has its own set of blacklist rules called disallowed phrases that prevent combinations of whitelisted words being used together in ways that could be just as bad as using a blacklisted word.

== Retrieve the Whitelist

This API is used to retrieve the entire Whitelist. You should use this API if you intend to retrieve the entire Whitelist and store it to be used for realtime feedback as a user enters content. If you only intend to send content into CleanSpeak to filter against the Whitelist, use the link:content#filter-content[Filter Content] API instead.

=== Request

[WARNING]
====
The Whitelist may contain in excess of 10,000 words and disallowed phrases. This API will return the entire list in the response body which may be several megabytes in size.
