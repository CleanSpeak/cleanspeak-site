|[field]#application.moderationConfiguration.phoneNumberFilterSpacePenalty# [type]#[Double]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `-0.02`#
|This parameter specifies a penalty that is applied to the quality score for a match if it contains one or more spaces. For example, `303 555 1234` contains two spaces so the space penalty will be multiplied by the number of spaces and added to the quality score.
