|[field]#matches``[x]``.length# [type]#[Integer]#
|The length of the filter match.

|[field]#matches``[x]``.start# [type]#[Integer]#

|[field]#matches``[x]``.matched# [type]#[String]#
|If the match is of the type `blacklist` then this will contain the conjugation or variation that the filter matched on. For example, if `smurf` is on the blacklist and marked as a verb, and `smurfing` is in the content, then 'smurfing' would be the matched value.

|[field]#matches``[x]``.root# [type]#[String]#

|[field]#matches``[x]``.metaMatches# [type]#[Array]#
|The array of meta matches returned by the filter request. Meta matches are returned when the `contentType` of `bbCode` or `html` is filtered and matches are found within the BBCode attributes. Meta match properties are identical to the `matches`.

Consider the following example content.
```
{
  "content": "[url=https://www.inversoft.com]Hello[/url]",
  "contentType": "bbcode"
}
```

Notice this content contains a URL match inside of a BBCode attribute, this match is considered a meta match.

|[field]#replacement# [type]#[String]#
| The original message with all matches replaced by a replacement character. If a replacement character was not specified on the request the default replacement character will be used.

{empty} +
For example, consider the following content.

Assuming `piss` and `jerk` are returned as matches, the following replacement string would be returned `\\*** off \****`.
