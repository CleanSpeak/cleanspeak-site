== Create a User

This API is used to create a Content User. Some examples of when this API would be used:

* A new user has registered with your application
* You need to bulk import your existing users into CleanSpeak

Content Users are also automatically created when content is sent to the Moderation API if the user does not yet exist.

== Delete a User

This API is used to delete an existing Content User. This API does not delete CleanSpeak Users (moderators). When a Content User is deleted the content for this user is also deleted.

This might be necessary for https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule[COPPA] compliance, or just to ensure that a user's information is completely removed. However, it is usually a good idea to keep user information in CleanSpeak even if they have closed or deleted their account in your system. Some cases where you should use this API are:

* A user deletes their account
* A user or the parent of a user requests their account information to be deleted

=== Request

== Flag a User

This API is used to flag a Content User. Once a user has been flagged they will be queued for a moderator to review in the User Alert queue.

For example, a user may flag or report another user. In most forums and games, players have the option to report other players for various reasons such as _"the user is being offensive"_ or _"the user is bullying me"_.
