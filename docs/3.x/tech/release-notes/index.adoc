_Released Friday, November 8th, 2024_

=== Fixed
* Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/84[GitHub Issue #84]

[role=release-note]
== Version 4.1.0
_Released Wednesday, September 4th, 2024_

=== Security
* Fix downgrade vulnerability with user sessions.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/83[GitHub Issue #83]

=== Enhancements
* Added new Machine Learning models:
** Incoherent
** Spam
** Unsubstantial

=== Fixed
* Weekly reports, when run from the cleanspeak/cleanspeak-app Docker image 4.0.2, work properly again.

[role=release-note]
== Version 4.0.2
_Released Tuesday, August 13th, 2024_

=== Fixed
* Work around Machine Learning/Perspective language auto detection issue by requiring locales to be selected when configuring a CleanSpeak Application.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/81[GitHub Issue #81]
** NOTE that not all languages and models are compatible. See enhancement below for details.
** Any existing CleanSpeak applications that used Machine Learning models prior to 4.0.2 will have English selected as the locale by default. After the upgrade, other languages can be selected as appropriate.

=== Enhancements
* CleanSpeak now validates the combination of enabled Machine Learning models and languages from the application page and the link:../../../3.x/tech/apis/applications[applications API] to ensure content can be checked without errors.
* Improved default Machine Learning score <-> CleanSpeak severity mappings for the following models.
** Identity Attack
** Insult
** Profanity
** Severe Toxicity
** Toxicity
** If you have "Expert Mode" enabled on your CleanSpeak instance under Settings->System->Filter, then the score <-> CleanSpeak severity mappings you have already configured will be preserved. Otherwise, mappings will be updated with this release.

[role=release-note]
== Version 4.0.1
_Released Tuesday, July 23rd, 2024_

=== Fixed
* Corrected missing `/api` prefix on API keys page and ensured existing API key permissions function properly regardless of whether the deprecated or new endpoints are used.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/80[GitHub Issue #80]
* Added missing `/status`, `/api/status`, and `/prometheus/metrics` endpoints to API keys page.
* Corrected HTTP status codes on `/status` and `/api/status` endpoints when API key lacks permission to call that endpoint and when CleanSpeak is not licensed respectively.
* The `/content/item/compatibility` endpoint, which was removed from CleanSpeak 3.30.0, has been removed from the API keys page. If permission for that endpoint was the last permission an API key had, the API key should either be removed in the UI or have new permission(s) added.

[role=release-note]
== Version 4.0.0
_Released Friday, July 12th, 2024_

include::docs/4.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

[WARNING.general-warning]
====
*Please Read*

CleanSpeak 4.0 changes the services/applications used. For more detailed information, see link:../../../4.x/tech/upgrades-patches/3.x-4.x[3.x to 4.x]
====


=== Enhancements
* Machine Learning models are now incorporated into CleanSpeak. These can be utilized on both the `/api/content/item/filter` endpoint or the moderation endpoint using a configured application. Use of these ML models is available for an additional cost
* A new `/api/health` endpoint is available for health checks, which can be helpful for Kubernetes use cases. It performs a more fundamental (e.g. just app server and database query response) check that's less likely to be noisy under load than `/api/status`
* Update the System > About panel in the admin UI to display
** Actual licensed features
** Database version and elastic search versions in use

=== Changed
* CleanSpeak is now a single package
** Previously, you would deploy a separate Management Interface and WebService. Now it's a single application. By default, the new CleanSpeak app will listen on port 8001. Any documentation references to Management Interface simply mean navigating in your browser to CleanSpeak on a single port.
** API endpoints, that were previously accessible on the WebService (e.g. `/content/item/filter`) should now be accessed via `/api`, e.g. `/api/content/item/filter`. The old endpoints still work, but as of 4.0.0, they are deprecated
** `/status` and `/api/status` are the equivalent of the CleanSpeak 3.x Management Interface and WebService endpoints respectively. The main difference is that `/api/status` will check that the filter is functioning properly, in addition to the basic application
** The new cleanspeak log file is located on Linux systems at `/usr/local/cleanspeak/logs/cleanspeak-app.log` or `C:\cleanspeak\logs\cleanspeak-app.log` on Windows systems
* Unauthorized API requests now return an HTTP 403 status code. Only unauthenticated requests (no/wrong API key) return a 401 status code
* `/status`, `/api/status`, and `/prometheus/metrics` authentication/authorization requirements have changed. The endpoint now requires at least 1 of the following:
** Logged in user (via browser)
** API key
** Request from localhost with `cleanspeak-app.local-metrics.enabled` set to `true` in the configuration file

=== Fixed
* In CleanSpeak Maintenance Mode (typically used on initial CleanSpeak installation), changing the Database type dropdown to postgresql properly changes the port to the default Postgres port of 5432
* When Maintenance Mode is enabled, the progress bar, after clicking Submit, now correctly communicates the upgrade is happening

=== Removed
* `cleanspeak-search-engine` is no longer distributed as a package. The product still uses ElasticSearch or OpenSearch as before, but **you must provide and maintain** a running search instance yourself. See link:../../../4.x/tech/installation-guide/database-search[Installation Guide - Database/Search] for more details
* Deprecated configuration properties of `email.*` have been removed (configured in CleanSpeak Settings in the UI since 3.4.0)
* Deprecated configuration property of `cleanspeak.search-servers` has been removed in favor of `search.servers`

=== Internal
* Remove Apache Tomcat as the underlying application server, in favor of a more modern HTTP server
* Upgraded Java from `17.0.3+7` to `17.0.8.1+1`
* Upgraded PostgreSQL JDBC driver from `42.7.1` to `42.7.2`
* Upgraded Elasticsearch client from version `7.17.16` to `8.12.2`


=== Known limitations
* Machine Learning capability is supported through proxy servers that are configured via the `proxy.host` and related options (see link:../reference/configuration[Configuration]). However, proxy servers that require authentication through the `proxy.username` and `proxy.password` properties are not currently supported. This is due to a known JDK issue

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.33.0
_Released Thursday December 28th, 2023_

=== Changed
* If you are using MySQL, the installation procedure has changed. Please review the installation guide to ensure you are able to download the MySQL JDBC connector as part of your installation process. See link:/docs/3.x/tech/installation-guide/database#install-mysql-connector[Install MySQL Connector] in the Database installation guide for additional details. If you need further assistance, please open a support ticket with CleanSpeak support.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/77[GitHub Issue #77]

=== Fixed
* When a phrase match is also upgraded to a username match, a filter request may return a `500` status code with an exception in the logs.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/74[GitHub Issue #74]

=== Internal
* Upgraded PostgreSQL JDBC driver from `42.3.1` to `42.7.1`
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/76[GitHub Issue #76]
* Upgrade Apache Tomcat from `8.5.72` to `8.5.97`
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/78[GitHub Issue #78]

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.5
_Released Sunday September 10th, 2023_

=== Fixed

* The Finnish inflector may fail when you configure a filter entry as Finnish and the word is entirely multi-byte unicode characters instead of ASCII.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/73[GitHub Issue #73]


[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.4
_Released Tuesday June 20th, 2023_

=== Fixed

* The filter may not reload after approving a blacklist phrase.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/72[GitHub Issue #72]


[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.3
_Released Friday July 8th, 2022_

=== Fixed

* The weekly report PDF may fail to render if the content contains unicode characters because unicode cannot be rendered by the PDF fonts.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/22[GitHub Issue #22]
* Fix up a few remaining uses of old email addresses or web addresses in CleanSpeak.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/68[GitHub Issue #68]
* Support Elasticsearch URLs containing credentials in the user-information portion of a URL that contain URL percent encoded `:`. This is the completed fix for the issue identified and partially resolved in `3.32.2` under https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/66[GitHub Issue #66].
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/69[GitHub Issue #69]


[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.2
_Released Wednesday June 8th, 2022_

=== Fixed
* Improve validation when importing a blacklist in the UI that contains a malformed locale string.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/59[GitHub Issue #59]
* Fix PDF extension when selecting the download report. Some browsers will not correctly infer the correct PDF extension, so the file may not automatically open with a PDF viewer.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/63[GitHub Issue #63]
* Support Elasticsearch URLs containing credentials in the user-information portion of a URL that contain URL percent encoding.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/66[GitHub Issue #66]

=== Internal
* Upgraded from Java 17.0.1+12 to Java 17.0.3+7 LTS.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/67[GitHub Issue #67]

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.1
_Released Friday February 18th, 2022_

=== Security
* Proactively upgrade Logback. Instead of Log4J, CleanSpeak uses Logback. In response to the recent vulnerabilities in Log4J, the Logback team has proactively added some additional hardening to their library to ensure similar vulnerabilities are not found.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/58[GitHub Issue #58]

=== Fixed
* Some OpenID Connect IdPs such as Okta strictly enforce only sending the `client_id` in the request body or the Authorization header. This fix is to only send the `client_id` in the request body when you request to use `client_secret_post` or `none` for the Client authentication method. When configuring OpenID Connect in the CleanSpeak UI, you may now select the client authentication method you wish to use with the OpenID Connect identity provider.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/57[GitHub Issue #57]

=== Enhancement
* Add the ability to override or provide additional custom SMTP options. This should allow CleanSpeak to be more compatible with 3rd party SMTP services.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/62[GitHub Issue #62]

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.32.0
_Released Friday January 21st, 2022_

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== Security
* Upgraded Logback to the latest available version of 1.3.0.
** No known vulnerabilities exist in the version previously shipping with CleanSpeak. As a resul of the Log4J vulnerability, the Logback team added some additional hardening to their library as a precautionary measure. We are upgrading to the latest version that includes these additions.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/49[GitHub Issue #49]
* Add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the VM options shipped with the `cleanspeak-search-engine` Elasticsearch package.
** Please note, this is only being done for good measure. Other mitigation steps are in place and are outlined in more detail in the blog post linked below.
** See https://cleanspeak.com/blog-archive/2021/12/10/log4j-cleanspeak for additional information.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/48[GitHub Issue #48]

* Moderate escalation comments not displayed in the escalation queue.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/41[GitHub Issue #41]
* Unable to perform an administrative score change on a content user from the User Moderation queue.
** This occurred when managing user at the URI `/admin/moderation/user`.

** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/27[GitHub Issue #27]
* If an event has never been configured (enabled or disabled) for a webhook an exception may occur when that event occurs, and an attempt to send that event to the webhook occurs.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/29[GitHub Issue #29]
* Attempting to action a user from the dashboard, and many other places is blocked by the fact that selecting an action does not update the rest of the UI. Specifically, the related controls are not properly hidden or shown, and the submit button is never enabled.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/31[GitHub Issue #31]
* When submitting an escalation comment that is longer than 255 characters saving the escalation will fail.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/32[GitHub Issue #32]
* When adding a moderation action with any one of location, sender display name, or receiver display name that is longer than 255 characters it will block them from being asynchronously added to the database. The action gets stuck in the queue and is never cleared or saved.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/33[GitHub Issue #33]
* Fix the queue drainer so that it is properly closed during shutdown.  Outstanding queue entries are written to disk, so they can be replayed later.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/35[GitHub Issue #35]
* The OIDC integration generates invalid OAuth redirect URLs when starting the OAuth login process. The URLs have two `?` symbols, which make them invalid.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/36[GitHub Issue #36]
* The css text color for `h3` inside certain tooltips is not correct. It's black on black, so you can't read the text.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/38[GitHub Issue #38]


=== Enhancements
* Add an option to the system configuration to use a proxy for all outbound network access to CleanSpeak licensing.
** See `proxy.host`, `proxy.port`, `proxy.username` and `proxy.password` in link:../reference/configuration[Configuration] for additional detail.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/24[GitHub Issue #24]
* Support `vv` as a leet speak replacement for `w`.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/26[GitHub Issue #26]
* Added a new reports UI to download a zip file of several reports: content, filtered entries, filtered words, moderator activity, top filtered users, and top producing users.  The new report can be found in the UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Reports -> Combined Zip Report#.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/30[GitHub Issue #30]
* Add a queue size to the queue drainer health check.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/34[GitHub Issue #34]

=== Internal
* Upgrade Apache Tomcat from `8.5.63` to `8.5.72`
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/25[GitHub Issue #25]

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.31.2
_Released Monday August 17th, 2021_

=== Fixed
* A missing JDK module in the Docker image may cause a runtime failure. This fix only affects version `3.31.1`.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.31.1
_Released Monday August 16th, 2021_

=== Fixed
* Updated Docker images to use new build strategy and correct the user owning the CleanSpeak process.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.31.0
_Released Wednesday June 16th, 2021_

=== Fixed
* When editing a webhook in the CleanSpeak admin UI, you may lose your webhook configuration during the save operation.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/21[GitHub Issue #21]

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.30.0
_Released Thursday May 13th, 2021_

[WARNING.general-warning]
====
*Please Read*

If you are upgrading from a version of CleanSpeak older than 3.4.0, you will need to reconfigure your SMTP settings in the Management Interface UI in order for emails to be sent by CleanSpeak.
====

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== Changed
* Removed System V init.d scripts from the RPM and DEB packages and replaced them with SystemD service definitions.
* Upgraded to Java 14.
* Upgraded to support Elasticsearch 7.x (version 6.x is still supported as well).
* Upgraded all dependencies for security fixes and improvements.
* Java is no longer bundled with the Zip, RPM or Debian packages. Java will be downloaded during the initial startup.
* When using RPM or Debian packages, the installation path has been updated to `/usr/local/cleanspeak` from `/usr/local/inversoft`. When upgrading, the `cleanspeak.properties` file will be migrated to the new location.

=== Fixed
* A JavaScript bug that may cause an error on the Approval Queue and the Content Alert queue has been resolved.
* Error when deleting Applications that had moderators working in queues previously.
* Pagination fixed for Application listing page.

=== Enhancement
* When under heavy load with increased database latency, it is possible for the User score processing services to cause additional database contention. This has been enhanced to perform some of the score processing during the request and short circuit some asynchronous processing that may require additional database locks.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.29.0-RC.1
_Released Thursday, April 16th, 2020_

=== New
* link:../apis/content#proxy-moderate-content[Proxy endpoint] for allowing moderate responses to instead be forwarded downstream to a different server than the requester
* Proxy configuration in the link:../apis/applications[application] moderation configuration. When you use the moderate proxy your application requires a proxy to be configured. These settings allow you to choose how to forward your moderate results.
* Webhooks section in the application settings. It was previously tedious to go to the webhooks page to select all the applications to apply a given webhook to. You can now directly enable webhooks from the application settings.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.28.1
_Released Thursday, March 12th, 2020_

[WARNING.general-warning]
====
*Please Read*

This release removes the SightEngine and Rekognition integrations. If you are using these features then it is not recommended to upgrade without considering the required code changes with your integration. These media features are now directly integrated with CleanSpeak for improved performance and capability. Use of these new media filters are available for an additional cost.
====

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== Changed
* Removed the SightEngine and Rekognition options from the system and application configurations
* Removed video content type from verification tool. Video is now always asynchronous so it is not possible to test in the UI anymore.

=== New
* Added Offensive, Nudity, Scam, and the [Weapon/Alcohol/Drug] filters for both image and video filtering
** Offensive can detect offensive content like swastikas, SS bolts, and middle fingers
** Nudity can detect x-rated content as well as suggestive content
** Scam detects images that are frequently associated with scammers
** Weapon/Alcohol/Drug filter detects the presence of weapons, alcohol, or drugs
* Added media filter configuration to every application
** Previously media filters were configured globally on the system configuration and now they are configured per application with far more fine grained controls for moderation.

=== Fixed
* Patched a bug where leaving locale blank on a filter entry could cause all pages to throw an exception due to new locale handling behavior in mvc. The form now detects the implicit locale and treats it as missing until we can change locale handling everywhere.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.27.2
_Released Thursday, February 6th, 2020_

=== Fixed
* Some TLD values could cause the edit button to redirect to a 400 page in tomcat due to the escapes present in the segment. This is both fixed in PrimeMVC and we use parameterized versions of the url to be safer
* Fixed an error on the alerts queue where the dismiss and ignore buttons would display their java toString value instead of the HTML escaped value.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.27.1
_Released Friday, January 24th, 2020_

=== Enhancement
* Improved HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
** Freemarker now escapes all printed values unless explicitly told not to
* Relaxed the requirements on ignorable characters to permit any character
** We previously restricted this to `a-z` to prevent unknown side effects but found use cases for characters outside of that range. It is still recommended to consult support if you plan to change this setting as it could cause surprising and wide reaching changes in filter behavior.
* Allow words to be repeated in the kids chat exact phrase builder
** This has always been allowed via the API but the UI was being overly strict due to a missing flag to permit duplicates

=== Fixed
* Fixed the verify tool not returning any matches if `All Locales` was selected. (Bug introduced in `3.27.0`)
** The `All Locales` previously mapped to null but a recent change in Prime MVC causes empty string (aka `All Locales`) to map to the Root locale. We now check for this locale.
* Fixed an issue that would cause moderation pages to throw exceptions if Elasticsearch was being provided by AWS.
** The status endpoint in AWS requires a leading slash and CleanSpeak was previously missing this slash. This was not required for standalone elasticsearch.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.27.0
_Released Thursday, January 2nd, 2020_

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* A new event has been added for Filter approvals. See link:/docs/3.x/tech/tutorials/handling-events#filter-approvals[Handling Events] for additional details.
** This event is fired when a change to the filter is approved. Filter approvals can be found in the UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Filters# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Approvals#.
** The default transaction configuration for this event will require all webhooks to successfully acknowledge the event in order for the approval request to complete. You may optionally modify this default configuration by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#System# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Webhooks#.
** To enable this new event for an existing Webhook, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Webhooks# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Events# and enable the **FilterApproval** event.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/12[GitHub Issue #12]
* Webhooks may now optionally select which events are to be sent. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Webhooks# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Events# to configure event selection.
* Webhooks may now optionally define a free form description field to describe the intended purpose or details of the webhook.
* Added a new `webhook_manager` role for managing webhooks. Users with the `admin` or `webhook_manager` role may manage Webhooks. See [breadcrumb]#System# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Users# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] to find the new role or use the link:/docs/3.x/tech/apis/admins-moderators[User API] to modify the users programatically.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.26.0
_Released Friday, December 13th, 2019_

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* Content storage controls
** When content storage is enabled, you may optionally configure CleanSpeak to store a percentage of the content to reduce the storage requirements of the application. While moderated content is always stored, using this configuration you may choose to only store a percentage of content that does not require moderation.
** When content storage is enabled, you may also force all content that contains a match to be stored regardless of the previous setting.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/7[GitHub Issue #7]

=== Enhancement
* Enhanced the URL filter accuracy
** Explicitly fixes `exampledotcom` but also fixes many other embedded cases where `dot` is used instead of punctuation.
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/5[GitHub Issue #5]
* Improved the OpenID Connect workflow so that we catch more problems with the configuration
** If the Token endpoint returns a 200 but the `access_token` field is missing from the JSON response then an error will be displayed indicating the problem is with the Token endpoint. Previously a generic error was displayed, indicating an issue with CleanSpeak.
** If the Userinfo endpoint returns a 200 but does not have the `email` field in the JSON response then an error will be displayed indicating that the `email` field is required and your OpenID Connect configuration is incorrect.

=== Fixed
* Fixed the TLD API to use name in the parameters/URI instead of using the one in the body on `PUT`. The previous behavior of supplying the name via the JSON body still works but is now deprecated.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.25.0
_Released Monday, December 2nd, 2019_

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* Prometheus endpoint at `/prometheus/metrics` (On both the webservice and the management interface)
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/3[GitHub Issue #3]
* Top level domain UI and link:/docs/3.x/tech/apis/url#retrieve-a-tld[API].
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/4[GitHub Issue #4]
** Top level domains can now be modified directly in the UI or via the API so that you can further modify the URL filter behavior
** Top level domains are used in CleanSpeak to identify URLs, this functionality already existed in CleanSpeak via a `domains.properties` file but has been transitioned to an API for ease of use.
* URL whitelist entries can now be tagged for use with specific applications
** Resolves https://github.com/CleanSpeak/cleanspeak-issues/issues/6[GitHub Issue #6]
** By default any entries that are not tagged will be always used
** Any entries that are tagged will only be used when an application that contains that same tag is supplied on the moderate endpoint
* Whitelisted URL link:/docs/3.x/tech/apis/url#retrieve-a-whitelisted-url[API]
** This API allows you to manage  whitelisted URLs for the URL filter.
* URL Whitelist Tag link:/docs/3.x/tech/apis/url#retrieve-a-url-whitelist-tag[API]
** This API allows you to manage tags for the URL filter

== Version 3.24.5
_Released Wednesday, August 14th, 2019_

[WARNING.general-warning]
====
*Please Read*

If you upgraded to this version please upgrade. This version has a flaw in the application cache that was fixed in 3.24.6.
====

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== Enhancement
* Application conditional reloading. Application cache will now only reload if a change has been made to reduce load on the database for situations where lots of applications may be desired. (Only affects webservice)
* Application UI conditional paging. If you have more than 25 applications, paging controls will appear and restrict the number of applications visible at any given time. (Configurable)

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.24.4
_Released Thursday, August 8th, 2019_

=== Fixed
* Fixed sight engine integration. The JSON returned from the API has changed since the first implementation

=== Enhancement
* Added partial nudity toggle to sight engine configuration in the System Settings. If enabled, the filter will be more strict about things like bikinis.

== Version 3.24.3
_Released Wednesday, August 7th, 2019_

=== Enhancement
* Silent mode startup. Added remaining required environment variables to allow silent mode to work. See link:/docs/3.x/tech/installation-guide/docker#silent-configuration[Docker installation guide#Silent Configuration]
** Added `LICENSE_ID` and `CLEANSPEAK_MEMORY` environment variables for overriding `cleanspeak.properties` variables

=== Fixed
* Removed revert button on blacklist whitelist entries pattern property (It was redundant since it was the only property)
* Fixed the UI for blacklist whitelist entries not showing the correct state.

[role=release-note]
== Version 3.24.1
_Released Monday, July 22nd, 2019_

=== Fixed
* A missing translated message in the Moderation queue could cause a page not to render properly in some cases. If you encounter this symptom contact support and we can assist you with a work around.
* When using a `cleanspeak.properties` file without the `cleanspeak-app.search-servers` property defined the value defined during the Search Engine configuration step of Maintenance Mode may not be persisted. The symptom may be noticed because the URL used to connect to the search engine will be defaulted to `http://localhost:8021` and not the value displayed to you in maintenance mode. If you encounter this issue, it can be worked around by adding `cleanspeak-app.search-servers=` to the CleanSpeak configuration file. Once this value has been added the configuration step in the UI will work as expected.

=== Enhancement
* The CleanSpeak Management Interface and CleanSpeak Webservice Linux processes will create a named directory in the `/tmp` filesystem during startup. This directory is expected to exist for the duration of the service process. In some environments this directory may deleted while the service process is still running. If this occurs and you attempt an action that requires this temporary directory to exist such as Import list or Generate Weekly Report an exception will occur. Additional safe guards have been put into place to protect against the possibility of this directory being removed during the process runtime.

=== Internal
* Enhance processing of the `cleanspeak.properties` during initial parsing to ignored lines that begin with a `#` indicating they have been commented out.
* Removed custom `java.io.tmpdir` environment variable in Linux init script. This change is related to the temporary directory enhancement described above.

== Version 3.24.0
_Released Monday, July 15th, 2019_

:warning_message: This migration will remove any existing external authentication configuration for Google or SAML identity providers. It is highly recommended to make a database backup in case you need to roll back. If you have previously been using Google or SAML identity providers for authentication to CleanSpeak please contact support so we can assist you with the migration. Moving forward only OpenID Connect will be supported as an external identity provider for CleanSpeak.

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__general-migration-warning.adoc[]

include::docs/3.x/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* OpenID Connect authentication method. This feature allows for easy login to the majority of external identity providers. Contact support if you need assistance with this configuration. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#System# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Authentication# to enable and configure OpenID Connect.

=== Removed
* The following identity provider configurations have been removed from CleanSpeak. Contact support if you need assistance with migration from any of these legacy identity provider configurations.
** Google Authentication. This configuration can be migrated to Google's OpenID Connect, this has been tested and should provide you with a equivalent configuration.
** SAML2 - If your current SAML v2 provider offers OpenID Connect this is the preferred migration. If your current SAML v2 provider does not offer OpenID Connect, link:https://fusionauth.io[FusionAuth] can be used to bridge this gap. link:https://fusionauth.io[FusionAuth] supports OpenID Connect and offers federation capability to SAML v2 Identity Providers.
** Passport. This integration is now removed and deprecated. If you were previously using Inversoft Passport you may migrate to link:https://fusionauth.io[FusionAuth] and utilize OpenID Connect.

[role=release-note]

== Version 3.22.1
_Released Friday December 28th, 2018_

[role=release-note]

== Version 3.22.0
_Released Tuesday October 23rd, 2018_

[WARNING.general-warning]
====
*Please Read*

If you are using the link:../apis/content#filter-content[Filter Content] API, please be advised the new Unicode filter described below is enabled by default.

The default configuration may cause CleanSpeak to return matches you had not previously encountered. The reason for this is that if the message
sent to CleanSpeak contains one or more characters from one of the default unicode match ranges the content will be rejected. A new match type will be returned of type `unicode` and
the response will include the indices containing matched characters.

If you have questions or concerns about this new filter and how it may impact you please contact us at support@cleanspeak.com.
====

=== New
* CleanSpeak now provides a Unicode filter designed to reject content containing characters in high order unicode ranges that are often used
to bypass filters. For example many character glyphs exist in high order unicode that render as an alphabetic character but are not easily detected. CleanSpeak
understands most of these replacement characters already but the possible variations are too numerous to account for every possible variation. The default configuration
provided should cover most cases, but you may optionally modify or augment the unicode match ranges. Contact us at support@cleanspeak.com if you need assistance.
** If you're using the link:../apis/content#filter-content[Filter Content] API this filter will be enabled by default. Please review the advisory above.
** If you're using the link:../apis/content#moderate-content[Moderate Content] API the default configuration will be to allow unicode matches, in other words CleanSpeak will
 not reject content based upon a unicode match. To enable this filter, find the Unicode filter rule in your Application configuration in the `Other Filters` tab, and
 find the Unicode filter options under the `Advanced` tab.
* CleanSpeak will now ship with a set of ignorable characters that will allow the filter to treat certain characters similar to whitespace and punctuation. This feature
is intended to allow more accurate detection of embedded words. The default configuration consists of the following three letters `q`, `x` and `z`.
** Example, the word `SxMxUxRxF` is the word `Smurf` with `x` interleaved between each character. This word will now be identified as a match on `smurf`.
** Example, the word `xSmurf` is the word `Smurf` prefixed with `x`. In some cases prior to this version, depending upon the filter mode, this word would not have been considered this a good match. Now this will will be identified as a match on `smurf`.

=== Fixed
* In some cases Reverting a Blacklist Phrase in the Filter Approvals would cause an exception and would not be be reverted. This issue has been corrected. If you encounter this issue prior to version `3.22.0` contact
 support@cleanspeak.com for assistance.
