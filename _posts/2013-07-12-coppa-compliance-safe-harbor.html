<h3>1. How can I qualify as a Commission-approved COPPA safe harbor program?</h3>
<p>A member of the industry or person must submit 'self-regulatory' guidelines to the FTC for approval. The Commission is required to publish the safe harbor application in the Federal Register (for public comment), and then writes a determination on the application within 180 days of filing.</p>
<p>COPPA safe harbor applications must contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicant's business model and technological capabilities and tools it will use to assess member operator's information collection practices</li>
<li>A copy of the full text of the safe harbor program’s guidelines and any accompanying commentary</li>
<li>A comparison of each program guideline with each corresponding Rule provision and a statement of how each guideline meets the Rule’s requirements</li>
<li>A statement of how the assessment mechanisms and disciplinary consequences provide effective COPPA enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The amended Rule sets forth the key criteria the FTC will consider in reviewing a safe harbor application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the applicant’s program includes guidelines that provide substantially the same or greater protection than the standards set forth in the COPPA Rule</li>
<li>Whether the program includes an effective, mandatory mechanism to independently assess member operators’ compliance with the program’s guidelines which at a minimum must include a comprehensive annual review by the safe harbor program of each member operator</li>
<li>Whether the program includes effective disciplinary actions for member operators who do not comply with the safe harbor program guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. What should I do if I am interested in submitting my self-regulatory program to the FTC for approval under the safe harbor provision?</h3>
