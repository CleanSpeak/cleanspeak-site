<p>Understanding the importance of internet safety is no longer something that can be ignored. It is an issue that continues to grow, and with that, so does the need to understand and identify where risk exists.</p>
<p>Inversoft would like to share an informative infograph highlighting a shift in online safety awareness. The details expose how often teens provide personally identifiable information, who they "friend", and the level of trust and confidence when privacy is of concern.</p>
