<h2>Business Strategy &amp; Value in Community</h2>
<p>An established strategy needs to be applied to properly measure community objectives and how they correlate with the business goals and its members' needs. Closing the gap between a business's vision and execution requires a properly planned and deployed road map.</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staffing full time community management</li>
<li>Integrating social tools and methods</li>
<li>Continuous evaluation and implementation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community Managers Matter</h2>
<p>Providing the proper resources and designating full time community management roles significantly increases the communities maturity rate. A community's maturity rate is defined by the business's ability to evaluate its current community strategy and identify the value &amp; direction of it’s roadmap based on the data collected within the community.</p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communities with dedicated community managers are 2X as likely to successfully measure the value of the community to the business's goals.</li>
<li>Dedicated community management increases member engagement. Those with multi-tiered community leadership programs see 46% of members contributing in some capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advocacy Breeds Engagement</h2>
<p>Identified as one of the most significant contributors to a community's engagement is providing leadership roles to its members. Taking the time to implement an advocacy program early on in the community will increase the amount of user-generated content, increase subject participation and help decrease the risk of ramifications from feature implementations.</p>
