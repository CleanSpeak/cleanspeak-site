<p>Working with a smaller software company can be a big advantage to customers that require a mix of nimbleness, quality and responsiveness.  This combination can overcome resource limitations to provide high value products and services.</p>

<p>Small companies are typically comprised of company founders and early employees who thoroughly understand the company’s mission, vision and product set.  This motivated group is quick to comprehend customer needs and is empowered to move fast to deliver solutions.  While large companies often have more resources upon which to draw, they are typically fraught with red tape and politics that bog down product development processes.</p>

<p>When a customer calls the small company with a support request, you don’t get a <a title="Technical Support Tiered" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support">tier</a> 1 employee working a list of scripted questions who must elevate all but the most routine requests.  No, when you call a small company – it’s all tier 3 level support, all the time.  The support team is typically comprised of the most experienced employees who can usually solve any request right on the spot.  When customers call with feature requests, they reach someone who understands the product design, as well as how that feature fits within the core product and what is required to produce the feature.</p>
<p>Smaller companies plan product roadmaps just like their larger competitors, but they are able to react rapidly and positively to develop new capabilities their customers demand.  A smaller company can pivot quickly from their planned roadmap and move a vital client need to the front of the queue.  While the big company product team is still struggling for internal buy-in to change their product development plan, the small, nimble company is already developing the solution.</p>
<p>When choosing a provider of software solutions, consider these benefits of smaller companies.  You’ll find you get a better product with better support from a team configured to respond quickly to your needs.</p>
