<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same Features, More Knowledge.</span></h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/website_features.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7654" src="/images/blog/website_features.jpg" alt="website_features" width="1705" height="1072"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our filter is still @#$%* awesome. We still protect your brand. We still help you maintain a clean and productive community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our core values have not changed, but our website has. </span></p>
<p>The reason behind this change was pretty simple: education. Based on current customer remarks, we wanted to rethink the structure of our CleanSpeak page, highlight core features and add/expand pages to add value and customization.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">But enough about us. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our newly redesigned website was created with you, our customer, in mind. We want this website to live as more than just another boring product page, but as a resource to educate people on what to look for when seeking a profanity filter. If nothing else, we hope our revamped website sparks interest in features and areas of filtering you might not have thought of. </span></p>
