CleanSpeak uses a <em>blacklist </em>for both graylist and blacklist filtering as described in the <a href="http://docs.inversoft.com/display/CS23/Filtering+Concepts">Filtering Concepts</a> section of Inversoft's CleanSpeak documentation. Each entry in the blacklist has many configuration options to enable the filter to perform different types of actions.</p>
<p>When adding or editing a blacklist entry, we have provided a field known as blacklist ignores that allows you to ignore any alternative form of a blacklist entry.</p>

<h2>Blacklist Filtering Explained</h2>
<p>Blacklist filtering prevents words/phrases from being used. Possible outcomes when CleanSpeak finds a match (or matches) on the blacklist include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reject the entire message</li>
<li>Replace the match(es) with a character or word (****)</li>
<li>Display the message to the author only but not display it to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also take additional actions within your application based on the type of match CleanSpeak finds depending on your business requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to resubmit the content in the case of forum posts, comments, and reviews</li>
<li>Send a warning message to the user</li>
<li>Silence or kick the user from the application</li>
</ul>
