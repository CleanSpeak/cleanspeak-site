<p>You have designed, produced and delivered a product that fits the demographic of 13 years and younger. There is no question in <i>your </i>mind that the product will flourish and be the next Duncan Yo-Yo, Pet Rock or Candy Crush. All you need now are customers and, possibly, an online community. Rather than throwing open that door with guns blazing and adding to the perpetual noise in social media, it’s time for research. The <a title="Digital Kids Conference" href="http://digitalkidscon.com">Digital Kids Conference</a> at Toy Fair in New York is exactly that.</p>
<p>Digital Kids provides detailed insight on how to create best-selling digital toys, games and media services for kids. The conference is a great way to network with industry experts, learn product design, marketing techniques, monetization strategy and online safety practices. Here are 3 things you missed at the Digital Kids Conference this year.</p>

Cohen suggests that because parents want and recognize their children's need to have a range of experiences, that is why it’s important and why we are seeing both traditional and digital toys flourishing.</p>
