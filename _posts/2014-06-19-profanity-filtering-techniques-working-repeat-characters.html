<p><em><strong>The fourth in a series of posts about the finer points of profanity filtering…</strong></em></p>
<p>Repeat characters is another commonly used filter attack that involves the simple repetition of characters in a word. This straightforward tactic still fools many profanity filters, most of which are not designed to ignore multiple instances of the same character:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllooooooooooooo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Profanity Filter" href="/features/profanity-filter/">CleanSpeak’s Profanity Filter</a> is capable of detecting this type of filter attack and will correctly and automatically identify words regardless of the use of repeated characters.</p>
