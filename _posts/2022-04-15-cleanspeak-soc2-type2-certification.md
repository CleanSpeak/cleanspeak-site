The CleanSpeak team is proud to announce that we have completed the rigorous audit process and have now earned SOC2 Type II certification for our entire organization, including the CleanSpeak product.

For those who have been patiently awaiting this milestone, or those who have been looking for details on CleanSpeak security and compliance, this represents the strongest external validation of our company and process. 

This certification is the result of demonstrating strict security and process controls over the past months and demonstrating compliance to a skilled third party auditor through an extensive examination of our operations. For many organizations, SOC2 is a leading indicator of the maturity and security expertise of their software partners. CleanSpeak has worked hard to demonstrate this level of readiness. 

For contracted CleanSpeak customers we will confidentially provide a full and detailed audit report upon request.  Please reach out to your CleanSpeak support contact or to your account representative for more information. 

The CleanSpeak community can rest assured in the fact that SOC2 Type II certification indicates CleanSpeakâ€™s high level of security commitment, awareness and preparation.
