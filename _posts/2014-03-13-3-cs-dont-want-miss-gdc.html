<span style="font-size: 13px;">Competition is everywhere and the gaming industry is no exception. Never has there been more of a need to create a conversation with a game’s bottom line -  its customer. Why? A game’s life cycle is only as strong as it’s company’s ability to understand the needs and wants of its consumer, the community it creates around the property, and its continuous collaboration.</span></p>
<h2>Customer and QA</h2>
<p>When gaming or software companies refer to QA, it is normally defined in the context of code development. Testing occurs the moment a piece of code is written for the property and throughout the development process. Another way QA can be utilized is directly with its users.</p>

<p><a title="5th Planet Games" href="http://www.5thplanetgames.com/">5th Planet Games</a> CTO, David Lease will be presenting an insightful GDC summit lecture on how gaming studios benefit by including the customer; diving deeper into quality assurance by allowing the user to share their experiences and knowledge. The lecture “QA via the Masses: Tapping into Player Enthusiasm” is sure to be a knowledgable piece covering topics and elements of game design, development and the many aspects of QA testing.</p>
<p>Takeaway: By including your advocates and creating transparency in the game’s development, you increase bandwidth while decreasing workload.</p>
<h2>The Online <b>Community</b>
</h2>
<p>What sustains an online virtual world is community. A community that thrives, engages and shares will extend a game’s life cycle far beyond its ability to visually impress. But what about the potential for abusive or negative user generated content?</p>
<p>Former Microsoft Studios controversial creative director <a title="Adam Orth" href="http://kotaku.com/adam-orth-just-had-one-of-the-best-years-of-his-life-1459900151">Adam Orth</a> will be presenting a detailed look at the dynamics of online behavior and the destructive mechanisms that occur not only online, but offline in the gaming and internet community.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Understanding the true “destructive” power of abuse and negativity in online communities, and who is at the forefront creating awareness and change in the gaming industry.</p>
