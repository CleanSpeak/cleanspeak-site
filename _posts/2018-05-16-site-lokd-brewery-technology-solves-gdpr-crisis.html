<p>The restrictions of the GDPR are proving to be a difficult challenge for web-based companies in the EU and the US. To address these issues, developers can implement a processor-minimal solution that solves the GDPR crisis. Now <a href="https://gdpr.inversoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open for testing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inversoft/gdpr.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code download from Github</a>, the solution is based on the advanced <strong>Site-Lokd™</strong> security techniques rigorously tested for decades by the alcoholic beverage industry. This robust solution leverages advanced <strong>Tru-Source™</strong> native language inference through predictive retinal spectrum and ergodynamic analysis persisted using our proprietary blockchain as a service (BaaS) platform. Post-digramic evaluation, the system efficiently delivers tailored <strong>ViewFork CTS™</strong> engagement pages to pre-qualified segmented audiences. Read on for more information on the origins of this advanced solution and how it can help you overcome the obstacles created by the GDPR.</p>

<h2>Industry-Tested Technique</h2>
<p>Throughout history, governments have tried a variety of ways to control public access to alcohol. Most have proven to be difficult to implement and range from minorly effective to laughingly useless. Even the passage of a constitutional amendment in 1920 that prevented the sale of alcohol in the United States was hardly a deterrent to the flow of beer and spirits and had <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/unintended-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many unintended consequences</a>.</p>
<p>One alcohol-control technique that HAS been successful has been the use of sophisticated "interruptive age-gates" on industry websites to prevent underage audiences from entering sites to be tempted by the information and advertising strategies within. First used on just a few sites in strategic test markets, the overwhelming success of these "age-gates" at segmenting site visitors into appropriate audiences quickly led to the near-universal adoption by all websites offering alcohol-related content. Industry experts often refer to this technique as a "Remus Gate", named after George Remus, one of the leading proponents of sensible alcohol regulations throughout the early 20th century. As websites and web-based advertising became more prevalent, it was soon trademarked under the name Site-Lokd™.</p>
<h2>Transitioning to the GDPR</h2>
<p>Inspired by the ubiquitous use of the Site-Lokd™ platform, developers realized the market opportunity and transferred the approach to one of today's emerging challenges: complying with the complex restrictions of the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Starting with the Site-Lokd™ platform as a seed value, developers worked with advanced machine learning algorithms and AI research firms to develop a new and improved gating strategy. The result is a combination of state-of-the-art components that makes GDPR compliance simple, efficient, and most importantly, foolproof. By combining the core<strong> Site-Lokd™</strong> platform with the evolved <strong>Tru-Source™</strong> native language inference, modern responsive websites are able to not only segment their viewers into unique audiences, they can connect the entire segmenting framework to the recently unveiled <strong>ViewFork CTS™</strong>. This content tailoring system (CTS) delivers unique content to each defined audience segment, providing appropriate geographically and legally responsible resources to viewers from explicit local regions.</p>
