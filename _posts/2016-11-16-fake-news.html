<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been on the internet this week you are aware of the fake news crisis spiralling out of control. But just in case you missed it, recent headlines read something like this: Facebook is being blamed for Trump's election, Google and Facebook Take Aim at Fake News Sites, Facebook’s fake news crisis deepens.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">With great power comes great responsibility </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has over 1 billion active users who utilize the platform to post, share and comment on news. When Facebook was accused of influencing the election, Zuckerberg was quick to say that was a “</span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/10/technology/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-fake-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pretty crazy idea.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Is it really that crazy? Facebook has become a catalyst for the spread of fake news given the ease of it’s “share” button. Regardless, fake news isn’t going away anytime soon, it will likely worsen and while Facebook has taken steps to </span><a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/15/facebook-fake-news-ad-network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit the sites' use of their ad networks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there has been no push to eliminate fake news from the News Feed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This daunting issue is not Facebook’s alone. Any platform that allows user generated content would be wise to get out ahead of this growing problem in order to prevent this spam and protect their brand. </span><!--more--></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s complicated, but not impossible </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is not new to this fight. They have spent years attempting to minimize the spread of spam/fake links and misleading content. To combat this, Google built an algorithm that prioritizes the quality and relevance of an article. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PR(A) is the PageRank of page A,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PR(Ti) is the PageRank of pages Ti which link to page A,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C(Ti) is the number of outbound links on page Ti and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PageRank follows this general rule of thumb: the more links there are directing to a specific page containing the search keyword, the more popular it is. As pages get more popular the weight of their votes increase proportionally and the resulting score increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can still write anything (fake or not), but not just any piece of content will show up in the first few pages of a Google search result. As a result of this vetting process people still trust the quality and validity of articles on Google searches. Facebook would be wise to follow Google’s lead.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authority matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s algorithm for determining quality rests on attention, if people are linking to a site or visiting that site, it is considered more worthwhile than a site with fewer inbound links and fewer visits (assuming all other things are equal). Google then uses that relative worth, or authority, to value outbound links. The more authoritative a site is that links to an article the more value Google gives that link. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attention = value = authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fake news it is much more difficult. Attention doesn’t necessarily = truth or authority. Facebook has proven that many times over. So, what does?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to not only assess the quality of the shared content, but the authority of the people who share it. A authoritative user could flag an article as fake, and if a threshold was crossed the article could be marked as untrusted. The problem is: how does a user become authoritative? And, what safeguards prevent an authoritative user from misusing their power?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authority is a problem we have had to tackle for our </span><a href="/products/profanity-filter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CleanSpeak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clients that utilize comment/article/user reporting. A user may report a comment or article, not because it’s fake, spam or hateful, but because they don’t agree with it. CleanSpeak applies a model to every user’s behavior, which yields an authority value. Reports on messages or users are taken in aggregate and weighted based on those authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/16/fake-news-alert-chrome-extension/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link#_yvCj6yJVSqZ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly available extensions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can create alerts based off of a manual list of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eA5-mCZLSS4MQY5QGb5ewC3VAL6pLkT53V_81ZyitM/preview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and/or Satirical “News” Sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this might not catch everything. It’s a great start, but authoritative users should have the ability tag and flag sources, too (as the number of these fake news sites is bound to outgrow the list.) </span></p>
