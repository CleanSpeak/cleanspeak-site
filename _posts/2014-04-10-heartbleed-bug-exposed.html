<p>You’ve probably heard by now that there is a serious threat to internet security.  The Heartbleed bug is directly associated with the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. The Bug exposes secret keys used to identify service providers and to encrypt traffic, usernames, passwords and other content.</p>
<h2>Why is it called Heartbleed?</h2>
<p>The bug is found in the OpenSSL’s implementation of the <a title="Transport Layer Security Protocols" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security">TLS/DTLS</a> (transport layer security protocols) heart beat extension. When exposed, memory content leaks from the server to the client and from the client to the server.</p>
