<p style="text-align: left;">Don't be afraid to fail. Don't waste energy trying to cover up failure. Learn from your failures and go on to the next challenge. It's OK to fail. If you're not failing, you're not growing.</p>

<p><a title="Denver Startup Week" href="http://www.denverstartupweek.com">Denver Startup Week</a> is moving and shaking. With over 5k participants there is so much knowledge to be consumed, so many ambitious minds to engage. <a title="Polsinelli" href="http://www.polsinelli.com/offices/denver">Polsinelli</a> was gracious to host one particular gem, the Denver Startup Week Breakfast.

<p>Start doing, don't ask permission, don't wait to get the ok. By the time you have the answers you are looking for from someone or something, is the same time you could have spent finding the answers by doing.</p>
<p>Take initiative. Take control. Be willing to risk and understand, without failure, there is no growth.</p>

<p>"Go deep on a few things, rather than wide on everything." says Brad.</p>
<p>When you decide to immerse yourself in to a project or activity, one that radiates passion just from doing, others will follow.</p>
<p>It is ok to get tired of a project. If it carries value and others have joined the cause, they will carry on the torch. With or without you.</p>
<p>Brad has been active with several non-profit organizations and currently is chair of the <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/">National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology</a>, co-chair of <a href="http://co.startupamericapartnership.org/">Startup Colorado</a>, and on the board of <a href="http://www.up.co/">UP Global</a>. Brad is a nationally recognized speaker on the topics of venture capital investing and entrepreneurship and writes the widely read blogs <a href="http://www.feld.com/">Feld Thoughts</a>, <a href="http://www.startuprev.com/">Startup Revolution</a>, and <a href="http://www.askthevc.com/">Ask the VC</a>.</p>
