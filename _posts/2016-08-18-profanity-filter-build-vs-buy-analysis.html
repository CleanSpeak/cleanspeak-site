<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “build vs buy” decision is paramount when discussing a company’s software needs. Building custom software solutions can provide a host of benefits, but it often comes at a cost. An intelligent profanity filtering and moderation platform is a significant investment; building a comprehensive profanity filter could involve years of development time accruing significant costs. Consider the following factors when deciding whether to purchase an existing profanity filtering technology or build it internally:</span></p>
<h2>Build</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a proprietary software you retain control of all aspects of product design, allowing you to create a customized solution to best fit your company needs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Control enhancements and development schedule</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the costs associated with software license fees – and in some cases maintenance and support fees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fully customize to fit your project scope and needs</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that by building your own profanity filter you assume the risk if it fails.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talented team at AOL implemented an internal profanity filter and was embarrassed by the now infamous</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scunthorpe Problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Years later, the Google filter and Facebook were stumped by the same issue. Learn more</span><a href="/blog-archive/2016/04/06/facebook-fail-properly-filter-scunthorpe/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These filter issues produced scores of false-positives which required significant man-hours in moderation support to address.</span></p>
<h2>Buy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase such a solution you get the benefit of a professionally developed and vetted technology with years of market use and added intelligence.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offloading filtering and moderation allows you to focus resources on core product features – essential to the long-term health of your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software has been used and trusted by well-known brands with strict quality requirements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistent product upgrades and new features </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete product support and software maintenance. When bugs or errors are discovered, you can rely on the vendor to troubleshoot and fix them rather than exhaust internal resources</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick deployment time </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a technology partner who is focused on helping you succeed and providing a better user experience</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a filter requires extensive knowledge of natural language processing and language rules. A filter that fails to understand complex language produces misses and false positives can be damaging to a brand. Get peace of mind with a proven solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to overlook the cost and time involved in developing a new technology as complex as a profanity filter. A homegrown solution requires costly development time and ongoing maintenance, moderation and support. In contrast, a purchased solution can be integrated and running in just days; it provides continual upgrades based on market insights and advancements.</span></p>
