<p>You have a product, resource or tool you know the world wants but they just don’t know about it yet. Old fashioned marketing efforts are dead, and rather than telling your potential buyer/user what they want, you listen. Listening is a key contributor in how companies direct many aspects of their business efforts and road maps. There is no better way to listen than by creating an engaging online community.</p>
<p>Listening helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain information from your users on how they perceive and interact with your product.</li>
<li>Develop trust by interacting and letting the user know that you are present and communicative.</li>
<li>Maintain your reputation. If a customer is not receiving the level of quality or service expected regularly, it can tarnish your brand's reputation.</li>
<li>Reduce conflict by being proactive. Spotting a potential issue whether it be product related or within the community helps enforce your brand's presence and integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listening is incredibly important, but so is engaging, sharing, creating conversation and letting others (your customers) advocate for you. But they need a reason to do so. Senior Reporter, <a title="Marisa Peacock" href="http://www.cmswire.com/author/marisa-peacock/">Marisa Peacock</a> shares, “Anyone can set up an online community, but what will make it worth joining is if it accurately reflects the culture of your organization and provides meaningful incentives to members.”</p>
