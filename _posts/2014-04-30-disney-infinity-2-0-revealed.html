<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5683 aligncenter" src="/images/blog/Untitled-6.png" alt="Disney Infinity 2.0" width="537" height="386"> Let’s keep it a little playful today. The Disney franchise has existed for over 9 decades, successfully and continuously creating engaging properties and childhood memories.</p>
<h2>Disney Infinity</h2>
<p>In 2013 Disney launched its new interactive platform, Disney Infinity, allowing users to play as their favorite Disney characters. Infinity has taken it to the next level. Players can build their own worlds, create interactive gameplay with every character (currently on the platform), and explore a world with infinite possibilities. Disney has quite practically built the digital toy box, successfully moving the creative game play from the living room floor to the digital world.</p>
<h2>Live Event Unveiling</h2>
<p>Today, President of Disney Interactive, <a href="http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/about-disney/leadership/business-unit-management-team/james-pitaro">James Pitaro</a> presented a live event revealing exciting new developments and additions to the Disney Infinity platform. <span style="font-size: 13px;">Rather than telling you all the details and the awesome new characters that are to be introduced in Disney’s Infinity 2.0 launch, a bullet point and video has been provided below.</span> <!--more--></p>
