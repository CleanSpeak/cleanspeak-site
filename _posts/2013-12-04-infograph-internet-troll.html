<p>In Internet slang, a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a forum, chat room, or blog), either accidentally or with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ Wikipedia</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyone that has contributed to an online community where user generated content is freely shared has dealt with this unsuspecting, antagonistic, deliberate waste of online space. But like the digital world, they grow, expand and create new ways to engage.  No, not in a positive way, but by getting past the preventative solutions in place to protect the honorable digital citizen wanting to engage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what exactly is the role of an Internet Troll? Inversoft would like to share a gem from Community 102 defining the details and online actions of the typical Internet Troll.</p>
