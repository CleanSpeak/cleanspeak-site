<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">When working with Inversoft’s profanity filter, CleanSpeak, the flexibility and thoroughness of  the filter provides multiple tool sets to test, customize and tune the filter to meet your online community needs.</span></p>
<p>A classic profanity filtering challenge is when words are embedded in other words. This is commonly referred to as the <a title="Scunthorpe Problem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem">Scunthorpe</a> problem.
