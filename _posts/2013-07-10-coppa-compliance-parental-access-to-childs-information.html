<h4>1. Do I have to keep all information I have ever collected online from a child in case a parent may want to see it in the future?</h4>
<p>No. If the child's information was deleted prior to the parent inquiry, a simple reply, "the information has been deleted and no longer exists" will suffice.</p>
<h4>2. What if, despite my most careful efforts, I mistakenly give out a child’s personal information to someone who is not that child’s parent or guardian?</h4>
<p>Although the Rule requires the operator to ensure the requestor of  the child's information to be the parent, if reasonable steps/procedures are taken the operator will not be held liable under federal or state law.</p>
