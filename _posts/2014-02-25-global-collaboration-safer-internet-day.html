What do a high school student who’s a bullying prevention activist, two criminology professors and Safer Internet Day have in common? They’re all sending the same message that safety and wellbeing online takes all of us.</p>
<h2><strong>The Student</strong></h2>
<p>Aidan McDaniel the student activist says school safety happens from the ground (the students) up. Social cruelty both online and offline isn’t a student problem that administrators and teachers can fix from the top down, he told <a href="http://www.publicnewsservice.org/2013-04-29/youth-issues/for-a-safe-school-it-takes-the-generations/a32203-1">Public News Service</a> when he was 16, it’s “everybody’s problem” and the solution doesn’t happen “without working with each other.” <!--more-->In a presentation he gave last November at the <a href="http://www.stopbullyingworld.org/index.php/attend/photo-gallery-2013-conference">International Bullying Prevention Association conference</a>, Aidan spoke inspiringly about how he and other students train peers to mentor younger students in bullying prevention. His father, a social worker for the Morgan County School District, told PNS that it’s “the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of our students more than anything [that] create the climate and culture of any school.” [See also this four-year-old article in Slate: "<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/family/2009/08/bullies.html">Bullies: They can be stopped, but it takes a village</a>."]</p>
<h2><strong>The Professors</strong></h2>
<p>Professors Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin, who run the <a href="http://www.cyberbullying.us/">Cyberbullying Research Center</a>, say that “everyone is looking for an answer to the bullying and cyberbullying problem. We know where it can be found: in teens themselves. We’ve met so many who are coming up with creative ideas, and running with them. They are spearheading movements and making a real, measurable difference.” Patchin and Hinduja’s latest book, <em><a href="http://wordswound.org/book/">Words Wound</a>,</em> has dozens of stories of students like Aidan who have worked in their schools to stop online and offline social cruelty in meaningful ways.</p>
<h2><strong>The Day</strong></h2>
<p>Where does Safer Internet Day come in? Because it’s now celebrated in more than 100 countries and with its theme for this year (“Let’s create a safer Internet together”) SID is modeling what both activists and researchers have long been saying: that safety and wellbeing on this planet’s increasingly social, user-driven Internet is – by definition – a social, collaborative solution.</p>
<p>This year, the U.S. is more synced up with the global celebration than ever, with two recent developments: a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-881_en.htm">2012 joint declaration</a> signed by the U.S.’s then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes to help make the Internet better for youth and, less than a year later, the appointment by the EC-funded <a href="http://www.saferinternet.org/">Insafe Network</a> of U.S. nonprofit organization ConnectSafely.org to spearhead the U.S. part of Safer Internet Day activities.</p>
<p>As ConnectSafely’s co-director, I can tell you from my own experience how powerful collaboration is. Our first task in joining the global network of <a href="http://www.saferinternetday.org/web/guest/members">SID Committees</a> was to reach out to a broad spectrum of peers in the Internet safety space, youth-serving organizations and Internet and technology companies to help us. All the logos of these partners who have been generous with their time, advice and – in the case of Microsoft, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Sprint, Symantec, Trend Micro and Twitter – financial support can be found on the <a href="http://www.saferinternetday.us/">SaferInternetDay.us home page</a>. We are particularly grateful to our friends and partners at <a href="http://youmediachicago.org/">YouMedia</a> in Chicago, <a href="http://www.southfield.k12.mi.us/">Southfield Public Schools</a> in Detroit, <a href="http://dc.gov/DCPS/">D.C. Public Schools</a> and <a href="http://www.gds.org/">Georgetown Day School</a> in Washington, <a href="http://www.pta.org/">National PTA</a> and <a href="http://www.4-h.org/about/leadership/national-4-h-council/">National 4-H Council</a> for their support in bringing nearly two dozen student leaders to our half-day <a href="http://saferinternetday.us/about-the-sid-2014-event-in-washington/">event in Washington</a> on Tuesday. Teens’ perspectives on and practices in and with social media are the focus of our highly interactive event, which will include remarks from featured speaker Sen. Charles Schumer and EC Vice-President Neelie Kroes (via pre-recorded video). There will be two panel discussions, one with a student panel moderated by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/author/dan-tynan">Yahoo Modern Family columnist Dan Tynan</a> and the other a panel of executives representing some of teens’ favorite social media services: Facebook’s Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Microsoft’s Xbox Live and Google’s YouTube. The industry panel will be moderated by Aidan McDaniel.</p>
