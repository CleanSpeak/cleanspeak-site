<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CleanSpeak can filter many types of user-generated content (e.g., chat messages, forum posts and reviews).  Running this material through CleanSpeak on a “per message” basis ensures each piece of content is acceptable before allowing it to be seen in your community. Filtering by message makes sense for these specific use cases. But what if you have big data that you want to filter as a whole?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batch Processing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wikipedia, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batch processing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the execution of a series of jobs in a program on a computer without manual intervention (non-interactive). Strictly speaking, it is a processing mode: the execution of a series of programs each on a set or "batch" of inputs, rather than a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">single</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> input (which would instead be a custom </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">job</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when might you consider batch processing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you purchased a list of names &amp; addresses and want to make sure they don’t contain any vulgar language before including them in your marketing campaign?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you allow users to upload files and want to make sure they don’t contain inappropriate content?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or you gather a list of reviews and want to check them all at once to ensure the language is acceptable before posting to your site?</span></p>
