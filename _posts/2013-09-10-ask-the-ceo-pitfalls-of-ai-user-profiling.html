<p>You are successfully growing your online community with awesome user experience and engagement. Would you risk all your hard work using filtering and moderation software that you can’t trust?</p>
<p>Some key considerations when selecting filtering and moderation software that uses Artificial Intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence systems attempt to use the User Generated Content over-time to infer behavior. They require training by moderators to make these inferences</li>
<li>Training the system costs a lot of money</li>
<li>The system makes mistakes (it thinks '!' means aggression only)</li>
<li>AI systems aren't smart enough and don't learn well. Even if you train them well, you often have to untrain them to avoid the '!' problem</li>
<li>Mistakes in training or maintaining the AI system can diminish the user experience</li>
<li>A rogue artificial intelligence profanity filter puts the site owner’s brand at risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Brian Pontarelli, CEO of Inversoft, discusses the inherent risks with AI-based profanity filters and user profiling in this 2-minute video.</p>
