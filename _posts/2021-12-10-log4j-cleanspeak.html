<blockquote>Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to our use of the Java Security Manager. Elasticsearch on JDK8 or below is susceptible to an information leak via DNS which is fixed by a simple JVM property change.</blockquote>

<p>There is no vulnerability if you are running in CleanSpeak Cloud. Deployments there do not allow external access to the Elasticsearch servers. If you need specific version information, please open a support ticket.</p>

<p>If you are self-hosting CleanSpeak, please review the Elasticsearch guidance and your Elasticsearch and Java configurations to ensure you aren't vulnerable.</p>
