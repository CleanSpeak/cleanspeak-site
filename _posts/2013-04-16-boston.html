<p>On behalf of the entire team here at Inversoft, we extend our hearts and sincerest thoughts to all those affected by the Boston Marathon Explosions.</p>
<p>It is times like these we are reminded to take a moment and be thankful for the freedoms and luxuries we sometimes forget, and most importantly those we appreciate and hold close to our hearts.</p>
<p>"Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you'll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you'll find that you have more of it."</p>
