<p>The team here at Inversoft would like to thank all those who made the 5TH Annual Golf Tournament for A Precious Child possible. We are excited and eager to continue to help and support such a cause. It is in our humblest opinion that A Precious Child and all those who support and make this charity possible deserve the utmost respect. As a sponsor, and all who gave charitable donations, thank you.</p>
<p>Next time we will remember to buy more mulligans!</p>
