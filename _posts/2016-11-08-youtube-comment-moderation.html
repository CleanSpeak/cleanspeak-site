<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YouTube comments section is a dark place where mindless, offensive words masked with anonymity are the norm; the infamous comments are some of the filthiest found online. YouTube has introduced new comment moderation tools to combat this very issue and tame the trolls. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube rolls out new tools for better comment moderation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube video creators can now pin comments, choose moderators and define blacklisted words or phrases. Additionally, a <a href="https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com">new beta feature</a> is available to automatically identify potentially offensive/abusive comments and hold them for review before they are visible to the public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, </span><a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/150312324357/160912-news"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a keyword moderation tool to keep comments safe by implementing a personalized blacklist. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound familiar? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might recognize these techniques because the are the very foundation of our robust profanity filtering and moderation tool: CleanSpeak. These recent changes made by Instagram and YouTube highlight a global push to combat online harassment, a mission Inversoft took on over a decade ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are acknowledging the need for community moderation and recognizing the value of pre-built solutions. Using the right tool can make filtering/managing comments, eliminating trolls and reducing spam quick and easy. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not too late</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While YouTube’s recent changes should have happened <em>years</em> ago, they are still just as important today. It is not too late to implement content moderation. We expect other online services, sites and applications to follow suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have user-generated content, you need a filtering and moderation solution. Don't wait, test out CleanSpeak <a href="/try-cleanspeak">free</a> today! </span></p>
