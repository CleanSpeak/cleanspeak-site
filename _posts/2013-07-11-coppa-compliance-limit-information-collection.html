1. If I operate a social networking service and a parent revokes her consent to my maintaining personal information collected from the child, can I deny that child access to my service?</p>
<p>Yes.<br>
2. I know that the Rule says I cannot condition a child’s participation in a game or prize offering on the child’s disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in those activities. Does this limitation apply to other online activities?</p>
<p>Yes. The Rule includes games, prize offerings and "another activity". Minimize and examine carefully how you collect information with every activity so it is "reasonably" necessary.</p>
