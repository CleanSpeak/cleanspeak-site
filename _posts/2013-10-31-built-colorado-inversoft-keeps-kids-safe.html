<p>Ruth Bremer of <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="Built In Colorado" href="http://www.builtincolorado.com/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Built In Colorado</span></a></span> stopped by the office last week and picked our brains. With Inversoft's new software release 'CleanSpeak 2.3' and the speed in which things are moving over here, we're surprised how much information she got out of us. Without further ado ...</p>

<h2>Inversoft Picks Up Speed</h2>
<p>Denver-based <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a href="/" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Inversoft</span></a></span> recently announced the release of CleanSpeak 2.3 profanity filtering and moderation software.<span style="color: #00ccff;"><a title="CleanSpeak Chat Filter" href="/features/profanity-filter/"> </a><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="CleanSpeak Chat Filter" href="/features/profanity-filter/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">CleanSpeak</span></a></span></span></span> enables community managers to more easily manage and drive engagement in their online communities. The technology is an intelligent, real-time filter that blocks inappropriate content and alerts the company’s moderators to offensive content or behavior. This technology works together with real-time human moderation to provide efficient, cost-effective protection for children and company brands.</p>

<p>Founded in 2008, Inversoft focuses on profanity filtering and moderation software. The company provides products and expert services to protect brands online from the challenges created by the proliferation of user-generated content, including the sharing of personally identifiable information, cyber-bullying, predatory behavior, and other online threats.</p>
<p>“We built the product to protect kids and brands online,” said Marketing Director Sean Bryant. “If you're truly concerned about either, you want to make sure the complete system is consistently effective.” While Inversoft’s rules-based filter approach is a very accurate, high performance solution, computers are still not effective at drawing context from language. “There are some companies trying to use artificial intelligence to pull context from the online conversations, but they just haven't proven reliable enough,” Bryant said. “At Inversoft, we believe the best approach is to combine the technology of an intelligent filter with human moderation to best protect kids and brands online.”</p>

<h2>CleanSpeak Bells and Whistles</h2>
<p><strong>Some of the new features:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="Filter Rules" href="http://docs.inversoft.com/display/CS23/Filter+Controls?utm_source=Inversoft+Documents&amp;utm_medium=Press+Release&amp;utm_content=Filter+Rules&amp;utm_campaign=CleanSpeak+2.3" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Filter Rules</span></a></span> Chat filtering customization and moderation workflow is improved with added front-end configuration called Filter Rules. Customers have always been able to update their filtering lists in real-time with CleanSpeak. Now, Filter Rules provide control for community managers to modify the behavior of the filter and content moderation when various types of behaviors are detected, allowing real-time updates without the need to change or update the initial integration code.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="Complex Objects" href="/blog/2013/10/01/complex-objects-filtering-forum-posts/?utm_source=Inversoft+Blog&amp;utm_medium=Press+Release&amp;utm_content=Complex+Objects&amp;utm_campaign=CleanSpeak+2.3" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Complex Objects</span></a></span>  "We saw the need to decrease the time spent moderating related content. Complex Objects is that solution,” said Senior Software Developer Seth Musselman. Moderating individual pieces of content from forum submissions is now easier, so moderators can evaluate and take action on all content at once. Forum posts are submitted as a single complex object allowing all content to be reviewed, approved or denied individually.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a title="Restrictive Chat" href="/blog/2013/03/28/types-of-profanity-filters-for-online-safety/?utm_source=Inversoft+Blog&amp;utm_medium=Press+Release&amp;utm_content=Restrictive+Chat+Filter&amp;utm_campaign=CleanSpeak+2.3" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Restrictive Chat</span></a></span> CleanSpeak’s comprehensive new Whitelist filtering solution provides "disallowed phrases" built from natural words to prevent abusive or bullying content. Since CleanSpeak understands language, it can filter all conjugations and inflections while providing real-time customization for those tricky variations and trends. This feature enables online properties to provide underage community members a way to engage and share with minimal risk.</p>
<h2>Breakout Potential</h2>
<p>As Bryant explained, Inversoft is a “classic Bootstrap story.” The company’s founder, Brian Pontarelli, developed an early version of CleanSpeak and took consulting and custom development work to make ends meet while the product gained traction. “The company has always been cash flow positive and we haven't elected to take any funding yet, preferring to grow organically,” Bryant said. “We think Inversoft has a great product, high profile customers, steady revenue growth and breakout potential.”</p>
