<p><em><strong>The fifth in a series of posts about the finer points of profanity filtering...</strong></em></p>

<p>One of the more sophisticated attacks that users employ against profanity filters involves inserting separators, such as spaces or periods, between the other characters of a word so that the word can still easily be read.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate how the simple process of inserting additional non-alphabetic characters between the characters of the word does not interfere with the reader's ability to identify the word correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>s.......m.....u.....r......f</strong></li>
<li><strong>s m u r f</strong></li>
<li><strong>s....m u r....f</strong></li>
<li>
<strong><em>I'm going to smas<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h it</span></em></strong><em> <small>(false positive!)</small></em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It might be difficult to see the profanity in #4, but if you look at the last 4 characters on their own, you'll see it.</p>

<p class="aftermore">Filters that do not intelligently handle separators will incorrectly identify this sentence as inflammatory and generate a false positive. Therefore, the filter must understand how word separators behave within sentences and how they can be used as an attack.</p>
<p>Separators can also be extremely complex. In some cases, other alphabetic characters can be used as separates without impacting the ability of the reader to identify the word:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>aaa<span style="text-decoration: underline;">M</span>aaa<span style="text-decoration: underline;">U</span>aaaa<span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>aaaa<span style="text-decoration: underline;">F</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">M</span>ight be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">U</span>nder a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>ain<span style="text-decoration: underline;">F</span>all</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Profanity Filter" href="/products/profanity-filter">CleanSpeak's Profanity Filter</a> is capable of handling separators that use common punctuation marks such as periods, semi-colons and asterisks. It is also capable of handling spaces without introducing false-positives. It understands that word boundaries are used correctly more often than not, but that spaces can still be used to attack the filter.</p>
