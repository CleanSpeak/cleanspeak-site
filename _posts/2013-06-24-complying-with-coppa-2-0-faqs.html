<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>GENERAL QUESTIONS  (1 - 7) of 14</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">1. What is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) is a United States federal law. Effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction from children under 13 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Website owners/operators and online services (including mobile apps) must provide a privacy policy sharing when and how verifiable consent is collected from a parent or guardian, and the responsbilities that apply to the operator when protecting children's privacy and safety online.</span></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Rule applies to all Internet entities that collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Commission issued the amended Rule December 19, 2012.  It becomes effective as of July 1, 2013.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Operators covered by the Rule must:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Post a clear and comprehensive online privacy policy describing their information practices for personal information collected online from children</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Provide direct notice to parents and obtain verifiable parental consent...</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Give parents the choice of consenting to the operator’s collection and internal use of a child’s information, but prohibiting the operator from disclosing that information to third parties...</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Provide parents access to their child's personal information to review and/or have the information deleted</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Give parents the opportunity to prevent further use or online collection of a child's personal information</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of information they collect from children...</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Retain personal information collected online from a child for only as long as is necessary...</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">2. Who is covered by COPPA?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Rule applies to operators of commercial Web sites and online services (including mobile apps) directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children. Additionally it applies to operators of general audience Web sites or online services with actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13...</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">3. What is Personal Information?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The amended Rule defines personal information to include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">First and last name</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Online contact information</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A screen or user name that functions as online contact information</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A telephone number</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A social security number</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different Web sites or online services</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A photograph, video, or audio file, where such file contains a child’s image or voice</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Geolocation information sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the operator collects online from the child and combines with an identifier described above.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">4. What should I do about information I collected from children prior to the effective date that was not considered personal under the original Rule but now is considered personal information under the amended Rule?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below is the amended ruling with 4 new categories of information on personal information. The amended rule covers the (additional) obligations and responsibilities regarding disclosure of previously collected information deemed personally identifiable information once the amended Rule goes into effect:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Geolocation information</strong>: if the site operator has not obtained parental consent, do so immediately... operators are required to obtain parental consent prior collecting such geolocation information, regardless of when such data is collected.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Images or videos containing audio of the child's voice/from a child:</strong> obtaining parental consent is not necessary based on collecting prior data to effective date of the Rule. It is suggested as a best practice to discontinue the use or disclosure of such information, or if possible, obtain parental consent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Screen or user name: </strong>is considered personal information if it functions as online contact information. Including, email or any other identifier that permits direct contact with a person online...</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Persistent Identifiers: </strong>any identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across platforms. Operators need not seek parental consent for these newly-covered persistent identifiers if they were collected prior to the effective date of the Rule. Unless obtained consent from parents or strictly for use for internal operations of online service (support), the collection of any information reflecting the scope of 'persistent identifier' will trigger COPPA.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">5. I don’t collect any of the newly-covered types of personal information.  Other than the changes to the definition of personal information, in what ways is the new Rule different?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The amendments to the Rule helps to ensure that COPPA continues to meet its originally stated goals to minimize the collection of personal information from children and create a more safe, secure online experience. The final Rule amendments, among other things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Modify the definition of “operator” to make clear that the Rule covers an operator of a child-directed site or service where it integrates outside services, such as plug-ins or advertising networks, that collect personal information from its visitors...</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Streamline and clarify the direct notice requirements to ensure that key information is presented to parents in a succinct ‘‘just-in-time’’ notice</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Expand the non-exhaustive list of acceptable methods for obtaining prior verifiable parental consent;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Create new exceptions to the Rule’s notice and consent requirements</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Strengthen data security protections</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Require reasonable data retention and deletion procedures</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Strengthen the Commission’s oversight of self-regulatory safe harbor programs</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Institute voluntary pre-approval mechanisms for new consent methods and for activities that support the internal operations of a Web site or online service.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;">6. Where can I find information about COPPA?</span></h3>
