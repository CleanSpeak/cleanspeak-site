TODO during dev
X Move resources from www project to this project
X Finish import.rb for WordPress
  X Need to translate DOC URLs to remove `cleanspeak` from the URL
  X Need to translate fully qualified URLs to relative (so domain name change doesn't blow up)
  X Need to Download images and translate the old WordPress URLs for them to new relative URIs
X Tiny-fy images
X Favicon

TODO WWW
X Remove all Webflow crap from WWW
X Make sure WWW doesn't have any links to the brochure site and if it does, make them go to cleanspeak.com for now
X Add a nav link in WWW to both product websites
X Move WWW code to accounts.inversoft.com in git
X Stand up new server for WWW (vanilla) and CleanSpeak.com with PostgreSQL RDS (no more MySQL yay!)
- Figure out if there is anything that needs to be setup for the server (like symlinks, Google CLI, Knife, Chef, Certs, init.d, etc)
X Stand up login.fusionauth.io and copy the database from the current einstein

TODO for launch (on new server)
- Copy certs over and then after launch update them with certbot
X Add redirect for docs such that the new location doesn't have 'cleanspeak' in the URL
X Add redirect for the inversoft.com pages directly to cleanspeak.com
X Add redirects for nested tag and category pages (i.e. the old site was /blog/tag/foo/bar and the new site is /blog/tag/bar)
- Setup metrics.inversoft.com, license.inversoft.com, etc.
- Setup redirect on https://inversoft.com (with certs)
X Add redirect that strips the final slash off old blog post URLs
