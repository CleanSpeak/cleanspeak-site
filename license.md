### 5.2

If Company believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Error in the Software, Company will so notify Licensee.  At that time, Licensee may (a) instruct Company to proceed with problem determination at Licensee's possible expense as set forth below or (b) instruct Company that Licensee does not wish Company to pursue the problem.  If Licensee requests that Company proceed with problem determination at Licensee's possible expense and Company determines that the error was not due to an Error in the Software, Licensee shall pay Company, at Company's then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred by Company.  If Licensee instructs Company that it does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense or if such determination requires efforts in excess of Licensee's instructions, Company may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem with no liability therefore.

In the event that Company fails to meet any of the Service Levels set forth in this exhibit (each such failure, a "SLA Failure") within a calendar month, and such failure is not excused due to any Excused Delay (as defined below), then Licensee shall be entitled to receive service level credits as follows (each, a "SLA Credit"):

**For System Availability:** The ratio of unavailable minutes to total potentially available minutes (net of Excused Delays) in the applicable calendar month during which the Service Level was not met multiplied by the monthly fee for the Hosted Services due for such month (1/12 of the annual fee if the Hosting Fee is paid annually).  <br><br> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the value of the SLA Credits exceed three (3) months of Hosted Services ("SLA Credit Cap"). Licensee shall notify Company in writing if Licensee believes it is entitled to any SLA Credit, which notice shall be provided no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the applicable month in which the SLA Failure(s) occurred, and shall describe the SLA Failure(s) in detail. If Company agrees that Licensee is due a SLA Credit, Company will promptly credit Licensee's account.  If Company does not believe Licensee is entitled to a SLA Credit, the parties will meet and discuss the issue in good faith. If the parties cannot mutually agree on a resolution, Company's determination shall be binding and final.  In the event Licensee brings any claim for damages based upon response times, then any such damages shall be offset by any SLA Credits issued to Licensee hereunder.

For purposes herein, "Excused Delay" shall mean (a) scheduled maintenance, (b) maintenance or service interruptions requested by Licensee and implemented by Company, (c) Licensee's breach of any provision of this Agreement that solely and directly caused the delay, (d) any delay solely and directly caused by any Licensee Data, (e) performance of internet services, or (f) force majeure under the License Agreement.
