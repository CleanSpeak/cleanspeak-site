When adding screenshots to the documentation, use a normalized browser window size. The following apple Script may be used to build a consistent browser window.

```appleScript
set theApp to "Safari"

# UI screens
set appHeight to 1100
set appWidth to 1080

# Wider UI screens
#set appHeight to 1100
#set appWidth to 1550

# Maintenance Mode Screens
#set appHeight to 1100
#set appWidth to 900

tell application "System Events"
	tell appearance preferences
		set dark mode to not dark mode
	end tell
end tell

tell application "Finder"
	set screenResolution to bounds of window of desktop
end tell

set screenWidth to item 3 of screenResolution
set screenHeight to item 4 of screenResolution

tell application theApp
	activate
	reopen
	set xAxis to 200
	set yAxis to 200
	set the bounds of the first window to {xAxis, yAxis, appWidth + xAxis, appHeight + yAxis}
end tell
```

When you need to build a screenshot for the blog, here's some code for that:

```appleScript
set theApp to "Safari"

# UI screens
set appHeight to 1020
set appWidth to 1220

tell application "Finder"
	set screenResolution to bounds of window of desktop
end tell

set screenWidth to item 3 of screenResolution
set screenHeight to item 4 of screenResolution

tell application theApp
	activate
	reopen
	set xAxis to 640
	set yAxis to 360
	set the bounds of the first window to {xAxis, yAxis, appWidth + xAxis, appHeight + yAxis}
end tell
```

Converting terminalizer gifs to videos
----

Gifs take up quite a lot of space: The brew gif was about 5mb, after some custom optimization it was only 2mb

To reduce the space requirements further, a video format is highly recommended and the dominant video format is
webm. Converting a gif to webm is cake: `ffmpeg -i terminalizer.gif terminalizer.webm`. ffmpeg will choose all
of the best default settings for you because the format is already specificly for browsers.

The problem is webm is not supported by safari (yet). You will also want to create an mp4 (which isn't always supported
by some of the lesser browsers because it uses codecs that require paid licenses inside). You also will have to
do some eyeballing on your video because safari is really picky about what it permits.

Example of my brew convert command:
```bash
ffmpeg -i render1555538879075.gif -vf scale=744x478 -vsync 2 -pix_fmt yuv420p brew.mp4
```

`-vf scale=` adjusts the scale of the output. The height and width must be divisible by 2!

`-vsync 2` makes the framerate variable and is great for terminalizer gifs because there are MANY duplicated frames
that this parameter will drop and significantly reduce your file size (by about half for my brew example)

`-pix_fmt yuv420p` changes the pixel format to yuv420p which is the magic sauce that safari wants (this is
also the part that needs a size that is divisible by 2)
