      <p><strong data-new-link="true">DENVER, Colo., </strong><strong data-new-link="true">WESPORT, Conne.,</strong> <strong data-new-link="true">July 1, 2014 –</strong> Inversoft, provider of platform technologies and services for enterprise level online communities, and Imperium, established leader in fraud prevention and identity validation solutions, today announced a strategic partnership that offers technologically-advanced solutions for creating safe online environments for kids that are also fun and engaging.</p>
      <p>CleanSpeak is an intelligent profanity filter and moderation technology from Inversoft. It has been adopted by some of the world’s most iconic brands to protect children while they participate in their online properties. The company also makes Gather, a feature-rich forum platform for online communities and Passport, an intuitive user management console. Together these software solutions are used to build and manage engaging online communities where clients and prospects can interact with each other as well as the brand.</p>
      <p>Imperium’s ChildGuardOnline is a patent-pending methodology for parental ID validation and verifiable consent designed to help mobile game publishers and website operators comply with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) while saving time and resources. ChildGuardOnline uses a combination of modern technologies and anti-fraud expertise to more accurately verify parental consent in real time. It also allows parents to easily monitor the sites their children have approval to visit using a parent portal.</p>
      <p>Inversoft Chief Operations Officer, Michael King stated, “We view this partnership as a meaningful addition to our eco-system. One of our key markets is children’s online safety. Imperium’s creative solution to the problem of verifiable parental consent and its reputation as an established technology leader make the company an ideal partner in the quest to create a safe online environment for kids that is also fun and engaging.”</p>
      <p>Marshall Harrison, Founder &amp; CEO, Imperium, added, “The genesis of the relationship is for both companies to fully leverage their respective presence in the online privacy and safety space for children. We are thrilled to have a technology leader such as Inversoft by our side as we help our clients meet regulatory compliance while also producing and operating fun, entertaining, educational and safe electronic environments for children.”</p>
