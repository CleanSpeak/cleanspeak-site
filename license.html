          <p>Support Services consist of (a) Error Corrections and Technical Support provided to the Technical Support Contact regarding the installation and use of the Software, and (b) periodic delivery of Updates when Company makes such Updates commercially available to its licensees. Telephone, E-mail, Verbal and Internet-based support shall only be available during Company&#x27;s regular business hours in Colorado.  Such support will be given (a) to answer routine questions regarding the use of the Software; (b) to assist Licensee in identifying and reporting Errors which may need corrections; (c) to assist Licensee in identifying and reporting new features and functional improvements that may warrant the development of an Update or Enhancement; and (d) to provide work-around solutions when reasonably available.  Support Services cover only, and Licensee is responsible for obtaining at its expense, Operating Environments designated by Company in the Documentation.  If additional implementation services are required due to any incompatibility<br> between Licensee&#x27;s Operating Environment and the Software and if Licensee requests Company to perform other services and Company agrees to provide such additional services (&quot;Additional Services&quot;), these shall be provided by Company under Exhibit B.  At Licensee&#x27;s request, Company will provide a written quote for rates or fees for specific Additional Services. Company will not be responsible for providing Support Services for any version of the Software other than the then-most recent release of the Software, except that Company will provide Licensee with Support Services for a reasonable period of time to allow Licensee to implement the most recent Update, not to exceed 6 months. Licensee agrees to maintain the Software to the latest version as soon as practicable and to incorporate all corrections and enhancements to the Software provided by Company.  Licensee understands that its failure to incorporate error corrections and enhancements will cause the Software to be non-conforming and that subsequent Software error corrections, enhancements and updates may be unusable.</p>
          <h2>3. Duration</h2>
          <p>If the License Agreement terminates for any reason, this Support Exhibit shall terminate as well.   Company may terminate this Support Exhibit or suspend Support Services if Licensee fails to make payment as provided under this Agreement or breaches this Support Exhibit and such breach is not remedied within 15 days after Licensee receives notice of the breach.</p>
          <h2>4. Payment</h2>
          <p>Licensee agrees to pay fees and other charges as specified in the Order Form for the Support Services.  Termination of this exhibit will not relieve Licensee of its obligations to pay all fees, other charges and expenses that accrued prior to such termination.</p>
          <h2>5. Error Priority Levels</h2>
          <h3>5.1</h3>
          <p>Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any sufficiently identified Error reported in writing by Licensee&#x27;s Technical Support Contact in accordance with the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by Company. (a) In the event of (i) a crash of Licensee&#x27;s computer network causing a critical impact to business operations that Licensee reasonably believes is due to an Error in the Software or (ii) Priority A Errors, Company will promptly commence verification of the Error and, upon verification, will initiate work to provide Licensee with an Error Correction.  For Licensee&#x27;s that have purchased Enterprise Support, Company will make the initial verification of the Error and report its findings back to by Licensee within 1 hour of the report of the Error by Licensee. Company will provide Licensee with reports on the status of the Error Correction every 2 hours. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 24 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee.  For Licensees that have purchased Basic Support, Company will provide Licensee with periodic reports on the status of the Error Correction. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 72 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee. (b) In the event of Priority B Errors, Company will commence verification during normal support hours of the Error, and upon verification, initiate work to provide Licensee with Error Correction. For Licensees that have purchased Enterprise Support, Company will make the initial verification of the Error and report its findings back to by Licensee within 6 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 1 week of the report of the Error by Licensee. For Licensees that have purchased Basic Support, Company will provide Error Correction in the next Update of the Software. (c) In the event of Priority C Errors, Company may include the Error Correction for the Error in the next Update of the Software.</p>
          <h3>5.2</h3>
          <p>If Company believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Error in the Software, Company will so notify Licensee.  At that time, Licensee may (a) instruct Company to proceed with problem determination at Licensee&#x27;s possible expense as set forth below or (b) instruct Company that Licensee does not wish Company to pursue the problem.  If Licensee requests that Company proceed with problem determination at Licensee&#x27;s possible expense and Company determines that the error was not due to an Error in the Software, Licensee shall pay Company, at Company&#x27;s then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred by Company.  If Licensee instructs Company that it does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense or if such determination requires efforts in excess of Licensee&#x27;s instructions, Company may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem with no liability therefore.</p>
